"""Refuse a script that reaches for a global its runtime does not have.

The two runtimes sandbox Lua differently, and neither script is where that is
written down:

  server   open77-base, server/src/Open77.Server.Scripting/Runtime/LuaResourceRuntime.cs
           `Sandbox()` removes io, os, debug, package, dofile, loadfile, load,
           collectgarbage, require.
  client   open77-base, scripting/src/ResourceHost.cpp `OpenSandbox()` removes
           collectgarbage, dofile, load, loadfile, getmetatable, setmetatable, and
           also io, os, debug, package.

A `shared_script` runs in BOTH, so it may use only what both provide. The offline
suite cannot see this: it runs plain `lua5.4`, where every one of these exists, so a
metatable in a shared file passes every test and then refuses the whole resource on
the client -- the session ends with `resource_activation_failed` at activation,
before a single module starts. That is the failure this gate exists for.

Usage: tools/check-sandbox-globals.py   (run from the repository root)
Exit 0 clean, 1 on any violation.
