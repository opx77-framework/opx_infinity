> [!WARNING]
> **Alpha.** OPX//77 runs on a test server and changes quickly. APIs, config keys and
> features may change without notice; it is not production-ready yet.

## What it is

`opx_infinity` is the whole OPX//77 framework in **a single Open77 resource**: a core
runtime, 35 gameplay modules, one Vue WebUI page and one test suite. It replaced
twenty-one `opx77_*` resources in September 2026. Modules talk to each other through
in-process contracts; other resources reach it through a curated set of exports and
public server events.

It is built around three rules:

- **The server decides.** Every request from a client is re-validated on the server
  before money, items, doors or vehicles move.
- **The client stays inside its budget.** Open77 silently kills a client coroutine that
  runs too long, so every hot path is measured by the test suite.
- **Never a name to a stranger.** A character's name is learnt in roleplay; no plate,
  chat line, menu or payload reveals it.

## Features

- **Characters and economy**: accounts and characters, cash and bank, jobs and gangs
  with grades and duty, company accounts, paychecks, needs (hunger, thirst, stamina,
  street cred) decayed on the server.
- **Join flow**: a join screen, the game's character creator, a name, spawn
  locations, appearance and a fitting room.
- **Inventory**: bag, hotbar, stashes, trunks and gloveboxes, ground piles with real
  props, weapons drawn from the bag, eddies as a bearer item, gives the receiver accepts.
- **Vehicles**: an owned-vehicle registry, keys as inventory items with a real host
  lock, garages with entries and exits, dealerships with showrooms and
  player-to-player sales paid into a company account.
- **Places and world**: clothing stores, teleports, job-gated elevators, map blips,
  server-owned time and weather, and **door locks** (a faithful ox_doorlock port with
  its own staff panel).
- **Jobs and crafting**: crafting benches, gunsmith armouries, a hauling delivery job.
- **Interaction**: target eye, key prompts with one owner per key, progress bars,
  emotes (every platform animation, solo and duo), holocalls and contacts, chat.
- **Interface**: one augmented-ui page (HUD, menus, forms, panels, toasts), recoloured
  live from the server's theme, in **English and French**.
- **Staff**: an F9 staff panel and eye rows, ACL-scoped commands, staff immunity,
  audit lines for every privileged action.
- **For creators**: server and client exports with a uniform `{ ok, value | error }`
  answer, public `opx:on:*` server events, runtime items, usable items, crafting benches.

Every module, with its commands, settings, events and refusal codes, is documented on
the [docs site](https://opx77-framework.github.io/opx77_doc/docs/opx_infinity).

## Quick start

You need an **Open77 dedicated server**, a **MySQL** database, and both repositories:
[`opx_lib`](https://github.com/opx77-framework/opx_lib) (the client library) and this
one. The full guide is [Install](https://opx77-framework.github.io/opx77_doc/docs/getting-started/install).

1. **Copy the two resources** into the server's resource root. The folder name must
   equal the resource name. The server only needs
   `open77.lua config core lib locales modules web` from this repository.

   ```text
   resources/
     opx_lib/
     opx_infinity/
   ```

2. **Load them in order**: `opx_lib` before `opx_infinity` (it is a declared
   dependency; the platform will not start `opx_infinity` without it).

   ```jsonc
   // server.jsonc
   "resources": {
     "load": [
       // ... the platform's own resources ...
       "opx_lib",
       "opx_infinity"
     ]
   }
   ```

3. **Connect the database.** Tables are created at first boot; there is nothing to import.

   ```jsonc
   // server.jsonc
   "database": { "enabled": true, "connectionString": "Server=...;Database=...;User ID=...;Password=..." }
   ```

4. **Grant staff rights** in the ACL file named by `accessControl.file` (usually
   `acl.jsonc`). A command namespace needs **both** its opener and its `.*` actions:

   ```text
   command.opx.admin          command.opx.admin.*
   command.opx.garages.*      command.opx.dealership.*     command.opx.clothing.*
   command.opx.doorlock       command.opx.doorlock.*
   command.opx.weather.*      command.opx.time             command.opx.time.*
   ```

5. **Restart and read the journal.** A healthy boot ends with one line per module and
   `opx_infinity 0.2.0 up`. `/opx.modules` and `/opx.version` print the same report in
   game. If something is off, see [Troubleshooting](https://opx77-framework.github.io/opx77_doc/docs/getting-started/troubleshooting).

The platform's `open77_notifications` package is recommended: server toasts sent with
`OPX.Notify` are drawn by it.

## Configuration

Every setting lives in [`config/`](config): one file per module (`config/<module>.lua`)
plus the runtime-wide `shared.lua`, `server.lua` and `client.lua`. Edit, then restart
the resource. Player-facing text is in each module's `locales.lua` and in
[`locales/`](locales).

See [Configure](https://opx77-framework.github.io/opx77_doc/docs/getting-started/configure)
and the **Configuration** table on each module's page.

## Development

Requirements: **Lua 5.4** (desktop), **Node.js** and npm, and an `opx_lib` checkout.

```bash
# the test suite boots the real manifest on a stub platform (tests/host.lua)
OPX_LIB_PATH=../opx_lib lua tests/run.lua

# syntax check (open77.lua is the manifest DSL, not Lua)
luac -p $(find . -name '*.lua' -not -name 'open77.lua' -not -path './node_modules/*')

# the WebUI: sources in ui/, the shipped bundle is web/index.html (commit it)
npm ci && npm run typecheck && npm run build

# the client budget meter: lists every client call site whose worst resume
# costs more than the figure (the client kills a resume at about 10,000)
OPX_BUDGET_METER=5000 OPX_LIB_PATH=../opx_lib lua tests/run.lua
```

CI ([`check.yml`](.github/workflows/check.yml)) runs the syntax check, the suite against
the real `opx_lib`, the sandbox-globals check (`tools/check-sandbox-globals.py`), and
checks that every Lua file is listed in the manifest and that SQL stays in storage.
