--- The player audit log, written as greppable platform log lines.
-- @author dop42
--
-- `Open77.log` says what the code does; this says what an operator will have to
-- account for later. The platform log is its only medium: every entry is one line
-- of the same shape, `[audit] event=... severity=... citizen=... user=...
-- player=... message="..." data=...`, so that a `grep` finds it again.
--
-- Everything here may have come from a client. A newline in client-chosen text
-- forges a whole log line, attributed to whatever resource the attacker names, so
-- every message and every data text is stripped of its control characters and
-- bounded. The cut falls between two characters rather than between two bytes:
-- cutting by bytes could split a multi-byte character and leave invalid UTF-8 in
-- the line.

-- The severities an entry may carry; anything else reads info.
local SEVERITIES = { debug = true, info = true, warn = true, error = true }

-- Longest message or data text one entry carries, in characters.

-- looping on a refusal costs one line and a count instead of a screenful.

-- How long a closed window is kept, so that the next entry can report its count.
local RETAIN_MS = DEDUPE_MS * 6

-- Recent entries by key, with their time, count and owner. The owner is stored
-- beside the key rather than parsed back out of it, because a key ends either
-- with the source or with the citizen id.
local recent = {}

-- Event prefixes whose info entries are never collapsed: six purchases in eight
-- seconds are six answers, and collapsing them would destroy the record. A
-- refusal under these prefixes is collapsed anyway, by its severity.

	-- megabyte to keep 64 bytes. A generous head -- four bytes per character is
