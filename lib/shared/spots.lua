--- The placed-spot vocabulary: the world box, the marker look and the record.
-- @author dop42
--
-- A PLACED SPOT IS A KEY, A POSITION, A BUCKET AND A LOOK, and this is the one
-- file that decides what one is. Five modules place something an operator writes
-- down as a coordinate and a player walks up to -- `garages`, `dealership`,
-- `clothing`, `teleports` and `elevators` -- and before this file each of them
-- carried its own copy of the same coercions under its own noun.
--
-- WHAT IT REPLACED, AND WHAT THE COPIES WOULD HAVE COST.
-- `modules/garages/shared/access.lua` and `modules/dealership/shared/access.lua`
-- held 334 identical non-blank lines between them, `diff`-clean: `build`,
-- `FromDefinition`, `FromWire`, `Serialise`, `Coerce`, `Spot`, `InBucket`,
-- `FlatDistanceSquared`, `Nearest`, `Marker` and `MaxDistance`, down to the
-- AVPAD-ring-else-cylinder fallback and the 0.06 ground offset.
-- `modules/clothing/shared/access.lua` carried the same record with the two
-- optional fields dropped, and `modules/teleports` and `modules/elevators`
-- carried the coordinate box.
--
-- They agreed on the day they were written, which is the only day copies ever
-- do. A drift in `Marker` is an AV pad drawn as a floor-height ring nobody can
-- see. A drift in the AVPAD fallback lift is an AV spawned half-buried in one
-- module and standing in the other. A drift in `build`'s bucket or key rules is
-- a car you can buy at a dealer and cannot recall at the garage a metre away,
-- because one of the two refused a spot the other accepted. None of those fails
-- at boot; all of them fail in front of a player.
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE.
--   * The BOUND box was left out of `lib/shared/math.lua` on the argument that
--     "a bound on world space is a policy about a map, and that library knows
--     nothing about one". That reasoning stands and this is the home it named:
--     a map policy, with the spot vocabulary that measures against it.
--   * `modules/gunsmith` publishes `Access.WholeInRange(value, low, high)` and
--     NOT `Access.Integer(value)`, deliberately -- one name for two signatures
--     is a call written from memory against the wrong one, and Lua drops the
--     surplus arguments in silence. It takes `Coordinate` from here and keeps
--     its own ranged helper.
--   * A teleport is a point with TWO ends and a leg, not a spot; an elevator is
--     a shaft with floors. Both take the coordinate box and the marker look from
--     here and keep their own record, because a shared record for four different
--     shapes would be a parameter per difference and no meaning of its own.
--   * The purchase-and-refund half of `dealership` and the bring-out-and-put-
--     away half of `garages` are NOT here and must not come here. They read the
--     same spots; they are not the same concern, and a base class over them is
--     the factoring this file exists to argue against.
--
-- IT IS PURE. No clock, no config read of its own, no module namespace: every
-- policy number a module owns -- its fallback shape, its default draw distance,
-- its use radius -- arrives as an argument, so every branch is reachable from a
-- test with no world and no two modules are forced to share a number they do
-- not actually share.

-- ── the record ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

-- A SPEC IS THE THINGS A MODULE'S SPOTS DIFFER BY, and nothing else:
--
--   noun      what one is called in a refusal an operator reads -- 'spot',
--             'dealer', 'store'. It is the module's word, not this file's.
--   maxKey    the largest key, which is also the database column width.
--   kinds     the set of legal KINDs, or nil when the module has one category.
--             `clothing` has one kind of store, so a store has no `kind` field
--             at all rather than a constant one nobody reads.
--   kindNames those kinds as an operator reads them, for the refusal.
--   heading   whether a facing is part of the record. A garage spot is created
--             at, so it has one; a store is only stood in front of, so it does
--             not -- and a heading defaulted to zero on a record nothing turns
--             is a field a later author will wire up by mistake.
--
-- Anything else that differs between two modules is NOT a spec key: it is a
-- reason those two modules do not share this record.
