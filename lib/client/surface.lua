--- One WebUI page: create it, talk to it, and know when it is not there.
-- @author dop42
--
-- Every surface on this platform follows the same boot sequence:
--
--   create -> the page loads -> the page emits `<id>:ready` -> Lua sends its
--   config -> normal traffic
--
-- A page must report ready before anything is sent to it: a send made earlier
-- is dropped, not queued, so `Send` answers false until `ready` arrives.
--
-- The CEF console does not reach the client log. A page therefore reports its
-- own exceptions on `<id>:diag`, and the handler wired here forwards them to
-- `Open77.log`: that channel is the only way a page-side failure is ever seen.
--
-- The WebUI bridge swallows an exception thrown inside an `Open77.on` handler,
-- so every handler registered here runs under a pcall that logs. Without it a
-- handler that raises fails silently and the page just stops responding.

OPX.Surface = {}

-- The five layers the host accepts. `system` is the only one that needs a
-- permission (`webui.system`). This was hardcoded to 'hud' on the evidence that
-- no other value appeared anywhere in the old tree -- which was true and was the
-- wrong conclusion: the layers exist and the caller gets to pick. The runtime's own
-- surface still asks for `hud`, because it carries the HUD and every view at once
-- and `hud` is the only value the shipped resources are known to use.

-- How many payloads are held for a channel that has no handler yet. A view emits
-- its `<module>:ready` ONCE and never again, so one is normally the whole of it;
-- the chat emits two, one per layer. The cap is what keeps a channel nobody ever
-- registers on from growing for the life of the page.
local MAX_LATCHED = 8

--- Holds a payload that arrived on a channel nothing listens to yet.
--
-- The page is built while the modules are still starting, and a module registers
-- its page handlers in `Start` -- which costs a FRAME per module, by design; see
-- the `Wait(0)` in `core/shared/lifecycle.lua` and the budget it resets. A page
-- whose assets are warm in the CEF cache mounts inside that window, which is
-- exactly what a reconnection is, and a character switch ends the session.
--
-- So `<module>:ready` reached a channel whose handler was three modules away and
-- was DROPPED. The module then waited for a handshake that had already been and
-- gone -- no HUD, no prompt strip, an inventory that opens on nothing -- for the
-- rest of the session, because the page reports ready once.

	-- inventory parks its open payload in `pendingOpen` and waits for a handshake
