-- `lib/shared/spots.lua` is the record -- what a spot is, how it is read off a

-- that draws spots did with them on the client, written once. `garages`,
-- `dealership`, `clothing` and `teleports` each held a copy of the marker set
-- (create, remove, reconcile, clear), and those four plus the elevator door each
-- held a copy of the key mapping (register, read the answer, the silent press).
-- Five copies of one behaviour drift; the eight-markers-a-pass cap had already
-- reached three of them and not the fourth.

-- Hung on `OPX.Spots` rather than a namespace of its own: it is the same subject,
