/**
 * THE SURFACE -- one CEF page, two layers.
 *
 * This was two pages. One build is simpler, and the duplication it removed was not
 * small: eight woff2 faces at 158 kB byte-identical in both, plus the Vue runtime and
 * the whole design system, twice. ~400 kB of 926.
 *
 * `surface` on a registration is now a LAYER inside this page, and it still matters:
 *   overlay  the HUD. Never focused, never takes a pointer, always drawn.
 *   modal    everything the player drives. Takes focus and the cursor when open.
 *
 * `allowFocus` is true because the page as a whole can be focused; `configureFocus`
 * no longer refuses it for the HUD, so the rule that a HUD must not ask for focus is
 * now carried by the layer a module registers on rather than by the surface it lives
 * on. A HUD module calling `acquireFocus` would take the player's controls away, and
 * nothing in the code stops it -- which is the one guarantee this merge gave up.

// `hideWhileLoading` IS EVERYTHING DRAWN OVER LIVE PLAY. The game's own loading screen

// drawing over it as if the player were still in the street they had just left: the
// gauges, the key strip that had said "take the lift", the toasts, the tags. While
// `modules/loading` says a load is up they are taken off screen and kept mounted, and
// each comes back exactly as its own module last left it.
