/**
 * The root of the one surface. It renders the registry and nothing else.
 *
 * There were two CEF pages here, and collapsing them to one removed ~400 kB of
 * duplication -- the eight woff2 faces alone were 158 kB byte-identical in both, and
 * the Vue runtime and the whole design system came twice. What it cost is real and
 * worth knowing:
 *
 *   * ONE FRAME RATE. `fps` is fixed at `WebUI.create` and the page handle has no
 *     setter, so the HUD and a dragged inventory slot share whatever is configured.
 *     60 is the choice: a pointer that lags feels broken, while a HUD that repaints
 *     more often than it changes costs only what CEF charges for an undamaged frame.
 *   * NO CRASH ISOLATION BETWEEN LAYERS. Two pages meant an exception in a shop view
 *     could not blank the health bar. Now only ModuleHost stands between them, which
 *     is a boundary in one JS realm rather than two separate ones.
 *
 * Every module is a sibling under its own ModuleHost, deliberately: siblings cannot
 * reach each other, so one failing is contained by construction rather than by
 * discipline. Nesting a module inside another puts the inner one's failures inside the
 * outer one's blast radius.
