/**
 * The one `createApp`, and everything that has to happen around it in order.
 *
 * There were two of these, one per CEF page. There is one page now, and `name` is what
 * is left of that: an identity for diagnostics and for the prefix on rpc refs, not a
 * choice of surface.
 *
 * The order below is not arbitrary:
 *  1. the dev shim, so a browser has a bridge before anything asks for one;
 *  2. diagnostics, so step 3 onwards has somewhere to report to;
 *  3. rpc and focus identity, so refs are prefixed before the first request;
 *  4. mount;
 *  5. `opx:ready` LAST. Lua takes it as permission to start pushing state, and a
 *     payload arriving before the channels are bound is a payload that is simply lost.

  // because a refused send is a `false` return nobody reads.
  //
  // It also RELEASES the page: every emit a module made from `onMounted` -- and each
