/**
 * THE FORM -- port of `opx77_input/web/{index.html,input.css,input.js}`.
 *
 * Text, choice and slider answered together in one modal. Like the menu it is a
 * renderer: Lua holds the authoritative buffer, runs `maxLength`, `charset`, `pattern`
 * and `required`, and answers every keystroke with the buffer it ACCEPTED. The page
 * reports candidates.
 *
 * That round trip is not caution, it is the contract in `form-spec.md`: "A refused
 * keystroke is not merely hidden: the accepted buffer stays as it was and the page is
 * told to put it back." A field that kept its own text would be showing a value the
 * server has already refused.
 *
 * Unlike the menu, this page always held the keyboard -- `input.js` forwarded six keys
 * to Lua and left every other key to the focused <input>. That is unchanged here, down
 * to the one rule that makes it work: LEFT and RIGHT belong to the caret unless the
 * frame said the focused row spins.
 *
 * -- DESIGN PASS 02 -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * THIS SURFACE NOW DRAWS ITS OWN FRAME, ITS OWN FIELDS AND ITS OWN KEYCAPS. It was the
 * last view still wearing pass 01: an `OpPanel` bay with `OpField` rows and `OpKeyCap`
 * caps, all three of them augmented elements filling the chosen row with `--op77-accent`
 * -- which is Night City yellow under `.op-theme-city`, on a surface whose neighbours
 * have all gone red and unfilled. It read as a screen from the previous build.
 *
 * The three components are not edited and not deleted: `PanelView.vue` and the entry
 * flow still render them, and changing a shared component changes every surface at once.
 * So this file carries a local copy of the row while the pass is being settled, exactly
 * as `MenuView.vue` says it does and for the same reason -- when the pass is agreed the
 * frame, the row and the cap go back into `design/` together, every surface takes them,
 * and the local copies are deleted in one go.
 *
 * THE SCRIM STAYS, and it is drawn here rather than imported. `InventoryView.vue`
 * dropped its scrim on the grounds that it was the largest fill on a surface with no
 * fills, and it is right about an inventory -- a bag is read at a glance and the player
 * is still standing in the world. A form is TYPED INTO. The player is reading their own
 * characters back one at a time to see which ones Lua kept, and a street moving behind
 * that line is the one backdrop this runtime cannot ask them to read through. The scrim
 * is also the `dim` flag's only consumer: Lua sends it per form and it still means what
 * it meant.
 *
 * Nothing about the protocol changed. Same channels, same handle guard, same six keys,
 * same candidate-only edits. Only what the player sees.
 *
 * -- THE ROUND TRIP IS NOT INSTANT, AND THE FIELD USED TO PAY FOR IT ------------
 *
 * `:value` is re-applied to the DOM on EVERY re-render of this input, unconditionally:
 * Vue forces the `value` prop through even when the bound string has not changed, and
 * `patchDOMProp` then writes it whenever the element disagrees. So between the `input`
 * event and Lua's answer -- one page-to-Lua-to-page trip, which at creator framerates
 * is longer than the gap between two keystrokes -- ANY frame that lands rewrites the
 * line to the buffer Lua held BEFORE the character. Under the first character that
 * buffer is the empty string, the placeholder comes back, and the field reads as empty
 * while the player is typing into it.
 *
 * The answer is not to let the page own the buffer -- it must not, Lua truncates and
 * filters and the line has to end up showing exactly what Lua kept. It is to make the
 * frames distinguishable. Every edit leaves here stamped with a sequence; every frame
 * carries back the last sequence each field was RULED ON. A frame that has caught up
 * is the answer to what the player last typed and replaces the line, refusal included.
 * A frame that has not is older than the caret and leaves the line alone -- the page
 * goes on drawing the candidate it reported, which is already on screen, so nothing is
 * written and the caret does not move.
 *
 * A candidate is a string this page HOLDS, never one it answers with. It lives for at
 * most one round trip, it is dropped the instant Lua rules on it, and `values` on the
 * submit is built by Lua out of its own buffers -- nothing here is ever read back.

   Writing `value` on a focused input drops the caret at the end, so a refusal or a
   truncation arriving mid-word would throw the player to the end of their own name.
   Vue owns the write -- `:value` is the binding and it stays -- so the caret is put
   back around it: captured before the element is patched, restored after, and only
   when the patch actually moved the text.

   The rule is the length delta, not the old offset. Lua refusing the character just
   typed shortens the line by one and the caret goes back one, which is where the
   refused character would have been; Lua truncating a tail leaves the caret where it
   was unless it was inside the part that went. */

   DESIGN PASS 02 -- RED, OUTLINED, TILTED.

   `MenuView.vue`'s style block is the spec and this is that idiom applied to a
   form. The two surfaces are the same thing seen twice -- a bounded column of
   controls the player drives with five keys -- so this one takes the enclosure,
   the interlace and the row, and the places it differs are the places a field
   differs from a menu row:

     1. THE FOCUSED FIELD DOES NOT LEAVE THE PLANE. On the strip the chosen row
        steps `--pop` across AND 14px toward the player, and it is that surface's
        best move. Here the chosen row is the one being TYPED INTO: a Z step under
        `perspective` resamples the glyphs a caret is sitting between, and the
        player is reading those glyphs back one at a time to see which ones Lua
        kept. The lateral step and the bloom stay, the Z is dropped, and that is
        the whole of the difference.
     2. A CENTRED FORM DOES NOT TILT. The tilt's sign and origin are derived from
        the edge a surface is anchored to, and a form ships centred -- anchored to
        none. Rotating a centred plane about its own middle sends half of it toward
        the player and half away, which is paper on a spindle rather than a surface
        receding; `InventoryView.vue` makes the same call for the same reason. The
        four menu anchors keep the tilt about their own edge.
     3. THERE IS ONE FILL LEFT AND IT IS A CARET. The browser draws it, it is one
        pixel wide, and it is the only thing here allowed to blink.
