/**
 * THE TARGET SURFACE -- port of `opx77_target/web/{index.html,target.css,target.js}`.
 *
 * Hold the key, RIGHT-CLICK what you want, LEFT-CLICK the row. LUA CASTS EVERY RAY
 * AND DECIDES EVERY ROW. This page draws the list and reports two things.
 *
 * THE TWO BUTTONS DO NOT SHARE A JOB, and that separation is the whole gesture:
 *   RIGHT asks. On the world it reports a pick; on a cascade that is already up it
 *         steps one column back; at the root it closes the eye.
 *   LEFT  answers. On a row it runs it, on a folder it opens it, and outside the
 *         list it closes the eye.
 * The one thing that cannot happen any more is the one that used to: a near-miss on
 * a row re-casting the ray at whatever was standing behind the list.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPORTS, and it is intents in the strictest sense this tree has:
 *  - where the pointer is (`hover`) and where the RIGHT button was pressed (`pick`).
 *    The press's own coordinates travel, never the pointer's current ones: Lua casts
 *    the ray at the point the player pressed, and by the time the handler runs the
 *    pointer has already moved.
 *  - which row was clicked (`select`), by token. Nothing else -- not the label, not
 *    what it means, not whether it should have been clickable. Lua re-resolves the
 *    token, re-checks the target and re-asks the row's owner before anything runs.
 *
 * WHAT IT DECIDES FOR ITSELF, and only this, because none of it is a fact about the
 * world: which folders of the group tree are open, and which row has keyboard focus.
 * Every row in the tree was already allowed by Lua before it was sent.
 *
 * THE THREE STATES, all three carried over deliberately:
 *  - LOADING is delayed by `LOADING_DELAY_MS`. A pick that resolves faster than that
 *    never shows a panel at all, which is most of them; without the delay every
 *    pick flashes a spinner.
 *  - EMPTY DRAWS NOTHING. Not an empty panel and not a line saying there is nothing
 *    here: the surface goes back to waiting as if the press had not happened.
 *  - the CASCADE, anchored at the pick point and kept inside the viewport.
 *
 * ── THE CASCADE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A folder opens on HOVER and its level appears as a NEW COLUMN beside the one it
 * came from. The parent stays on screen with its folder row lit, so the whole trail
 * is visible at once instead of one level at a time.
 *
 * `path` is still the single source of truth -- it is the trail of open folder names
 * -- but it no longer selects ONE level. `columns` derives one level per PREFIX of
 * it, so a path of `['Staff', 'Weather']` is three columns: the root, Staff, and
 * Weather. Nothing about the payload or the channels changed; this is a different
 * projection of the same `group` strings Lua already sends.
 *
 * THE HARD PART IS NOT THE LAYOUT, IT IS THE POINTER. Moving diagonally from a
 * folder row to its child column crosses the parent's OTHER rows, and a naive
 * implementation closes the child before the pointer arrives. See `inCorridor`.
 *
 * ── THE SUBMENU THAT OPENED AND WENT STRAIGHT BACK ───────────────────────────
 *
 * Kept, because the fix below is what makes the paragraph above safe.
 *
 * A folder row opened its level and the list snapped back to the root immediately:
 *
 *   1. `.eye-room` carried the `@click` that reported a pick. That handler is the
 *      CANCEL now and the trap is word for word the same one, so none of this is
 *      only history. The guard against firing it for a click on the list itself was
 *      `listEl.contains(event.target)` -- evaluated in the BUBBLE phase, after the
 *      row's own handler had run.
 *   2. Between two listeners of one dispatch the browser runs a microtask
 *      checkpoint, and Vue's scheduler flushes on a microtask. So the level change
 *      was already painted by the time the click reached `.eye-room`: the clicked
 *      row -- keyed, and gone from the new level -- had been UNMOUNTED.
 *   3. The event path is computed once at dispatch and retained, so `.eye-room`
 *      still ran, now holding an `event.target` that no longer had a parent.
 *      `contains` answered false, and the page reported a fresh pick at the folder
 *      row's coordinates. Lua obliged: `target:loading` resets the trail and
 *      `target:menu` redraws the root. The submenu opened, then went back.
 *
 * The guard is now taken on the CASCADE WRAPPER, which survives every level change
 * there is -- see `onListCapture`. Re-reasoned for hover in `applyPath`.
 *
 * ── DESIGN PASS 02 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THIS SURFACE DRAWS ITS OWN ROWS AND ITS OWN SPINNER, for the same reason
 * `MenuView.vue` does: `OpPanel`, `OpRow` and `OpSpinner` are shared with prompts,
 * panel and the entry form, they are built on augmented-ui, and all three paint
 * `--op77-accent` -- which `.op-theme-city` makes Night City yellow. This pass is
 * red and tilted, so the three go and the row is drawn here.
 *
 * IT DRAWS NO PANEL AT ALL. A column has no enclosure: the rows sit loose on the
 * gameplay plane. See point 3 of the style header for what that cost and what paid
 * for it.
 *
 * Nothing about the protocol changed. Same channels, same payload fields, same
 * handle guard, same focus call.

/* =============================================================================
   DESIGN PASS 02 -- RED, OUTLINED, TILTED.

   The menu surface is the agreed reference and this is its idiom, not a variation
   on it: nothing is filled, a CONTROL is a closed frame with the top-right corner
   chamfered, the red has three steps plus a hot rung, everything carries a black
   shadow, and state changes cut rather than fade.

   WHAT IS NOT THE MENU, and all four are forced by what this surface is:

     1. IT IS ANCHORED TO A POINT, NOT TO A SCREEN EDGE, so the leading edge is
        decided at runtime. Every mirrored thing -- the tilt sign, the direction the
        cascade grows, the row's runway -- is keyed off `.flip`.
     2. IT IS A CASCADE. One column per level of the open trail, laid out by flexbox
        with one `gap`, reversed as a WHOLE when it grows left. A column is its own
        plane: its own perspective, its own tilt, its own containment.
     3. A COLUMN HAS NO ENCLOSURE. No chamfered container outline, no arete, no
        backing -- and NO INTERLACE, which is the part that needed deciding rather
        than deleting. The interlace was justified as the thing that stops an
        unfilled FRAME reading as a web page floating in the air. With the frame
        gone there is nothing for it to sit inside, so a striped rectangle with a
        hard edge IS that floating web page: it would be the only drawn boundary
        left, and it would be one nobody asked for. It goes with the box. What
        holds a column together now is that its rows share an x and a tilt, and
        what keeps them legible over a blown-out plaza is the black underlay in
        each row's sprite and the two-pass text-shadow -- both per row, both
        already there.
     4. NO RETICLE. The state Lua reports about the point under the pointer is on
        the CURSOR now (`default` / `pointer` / `progress`), which is what a cursor
        is for and one fewer thing drawn over the street.

   WHY `border-image` AND NOT `clip-path` FOR A ROW. A clip cuts the painted
   result, so a bordered box under one loses its stroke exactly along the diagonal
   and the chamfer arrives as a GAP. The reference solves it with 9-slice sprites
   and so does this: one SVG data URI per state, 8px corner tiles carrying the
   chamfer at a fixed size while the edge tiles stretch. A state change swaps
   `border-image-source` and `color` and nothing else -- no fill, no clip and no
   filter per row, because this page composites over live gameplay at a frame rate
   fixed when the surface was created.

   AND WHY THE SHADOW IS INSIDE THE SPRITE. An outset `box-shadow` follows the
   BORDER BOX, never the `border-image` painted over it, so on a chamfered control
   the blur ran straight past the diagonal and squared off the one corner the shape
   is about. Every sprite here carries a wide black stroke on the same path under
   the coloured one instead: it traces the chamfer exactly, it rasterises once when
   the image decodes, and a state change is still one property. The 4.5px underlay
   reaches ~2.25px either side of the path and the corner tile is 8px, so it lands
   inside the tile and is never stretched down an edge.
   ========================================================================== */

/* The room owns the whole screen while it is up: it reads the pointer everywhere.
   Closed, this element does not exist at all, so the surface underneath is
   untouched.

   IT DRAWS NO RETICLE. It used to replace the system cursor with an eye, which is
