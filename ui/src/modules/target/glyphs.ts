/**
 * The row glyphs, carried over verbatim from `GLYPHS` in `opx77_target/web/target.js`.
 *
 * Inline path data and not an icon font: there is no network inside a CEF surface, so a
 * font would resolve to nothing and every row would show a blank box. Paths rather than
 * markup strings because the original built them with `createElementNS`, and `v-html` on
 * a payload-selected key is the same hole with a Vue accent.
 *
 * The set is CLOSED and Lua validates against the same names, so an unknown name is a
 * bug on one side or the other and falls back to `interact` rather than travelling
 * into an attribute nobody wrote.
 *
 * LUA HAS ONE LIST AND IT IS `core/shared/glyphs.lua`. `Model.ICONS` and `menu.M.ICONS`
 * are now ALIASES of that one table -- literally `= OPX.Glyphs` -- and the third name
 * this header used to send you to was deleted outright. It instructed the next author
 * to keep three hand-kept Lua lists in step in the same change, which is exactly the
 * regime that produced 47 names, 45 and 14 with no test looking. There is one Lua list,
 * it is generated from THIS file because the page is what can actually draw a path, and
 * `tests/` reads both files and holds them together -- the one seam no shared file can
 * close, a `.ts` being unloadable from Lua.
 *
 * `currentColor` is what carries the tone rules down to the stroke, so nothing here
 * names a colour.

  /* ── THE SECOND BAND ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
     Added so that EVERY row of every list can carry a glyph that says what it
     is. The first fourteen were the target eye's own vocabulary, and a menu
     drawn out of them alone said `tool` fourteen times over: the noclip switch,
     the weather presets, the ped families and the vehicle flags were all one
     picture, which is the same as no picture.

     Same rules as above, and they are why this is one flat object and not a
     second one: 24x24, stroke only, no fill, no colour, paths and not markup.
     A name added here is added to `core/shared/glyphs.lua` in the same change --
     the single list every Lua validator reads -- and a name in this file that is
     not in it can never reach a row. The suite fails if the two drift. */
