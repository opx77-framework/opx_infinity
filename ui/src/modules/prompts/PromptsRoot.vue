/**
 * THE KEY STRIP -- the port of `opx77_prompts/web/{index.html,prompts.js,prompts.css}`.
 *
 * It decides nothing, exactly as prompts.js decided nothing. Order, the cut to the row
 * budget and every key NAME arrive resolved: a cap says what the player's own binding
 * says, and this page has no keyboard layout to map a scancode with.
 *
 * ── DESIGN PASS 02 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A PROMPT IS A LINE, NOT A BOX. It was an `OpPanel` per group holding padded rows: an
 * augmented frame, a header with a bottom rule, a body with inner padding, and a
 * `--op77-accent-soft` fill under every keycap. All of that is gone. What is left is
 * one inline row -- the key, then what it does -- and nothing drawn around it.
 *
 * NO ENCLOSURE, and this is now the house rule rather than a local choice: HudInfo.vue
 * and HudVoice.vue made the same call, the ALT target and the inventory after them, and
 * the pre-rebuild `opx77_prompts` drew no enclosure either. A prompt is the most
 * transient thing on the screen -- it appears because the player walked up to a door --
 * and a framed panel says "drive me", which is exactly what a prompt is not.
 *
 * THE INTERLACE DOES NOT SURVIVE, for the reason spelled out in HudVoice.vue: it exists
 * to stop an unfilled FRAME reading as a web page floating in the air, and with no frame
 * a striped rectangle IS that floating rectangle. The strip has no bounds of its own now,
 * so there is nothing to stripe -- only lines, and each one is lifted off the street by
 * the black ink shadow instead.
 *
 * THE KEYCAP KEEPS ITS EDGE, and it is the only thing here that does. It is a control,
 * and it depicts a physical key: a key with no edge is a word, and `E OPEN` is two words
 * where `[E] OPEN` is an instruction. So the cap takes the house 9-slice frame -- the same
 * sprite MenuView.vue and the HUD draw -- and nothing else does. `OpKeyCap` could not
 * survive that: it is `data-augmented-ui` plus an `--op77-accent-soft` fill plus a 2px
 * accent under-rule, and a bottom rule 2px thick IS a fill however thin. The weighted
 * base goes with it, so a held key no longer reads as a heavier cap -- see below, the
 * hold tag went the same way.
 *
 * THE HOLD TAG IS GONE. Lua still sends `hold` per row and `prompts.hold` in the config,
 * and this page no longer reads either: a word beside the cap saying HOLD was a caption
 * on a keycap, and the owner called it what it was. The Lua contract is untouched -- the
 * field is validated, change-gated and sent exactly as before, and drawn by nobody, the
 * same standing as `payload.eyebrow` in HudInfo.vue.

   Read MenuView.vue's `<style scoped>` first: it is the agreed reference and this

   the menu is a thing the player drives and a control is a closed frame; a prompt
   is a thing the player is told, and it sits loose on the gameplay plane like the
   rest of the HUD.

   WHAT A LINE COSTS. Per row: no fill, no filter, no frame on the row itself.
   One augmented keycap, whose shape is CSS and whose whole state is one custom
   property. The strip's entire paint is the type and the caps.
