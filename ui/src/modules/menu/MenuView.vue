/**
 * THE MENU -- port of `opx77_menu/web/{index.html,menu.css,menu.js}`.
 *
 * The strip is a RENDERER and nothing else, exactly as the original was: Lua owns the
 * navigation stack, the cursor and the window of rows, and `opx:menu:frame` is the
 * window it decided to draw. Nothing here moves a cursor, flips a checkbox or resolves
 * a submenu -- see `opx77_menu/docs/ARCHITECTURE.md`, "Navigation", where every one of
 * those lives in `client/model.lua`.
 *
 * ONE THING MOVED, and it had to. The original page was created on the `hud` layer
 * precisely so it could never be focused, and Lua read the six keys itself through
 * `Open77.input.isDown` with its own 260ms/55ms repeat machine. This surface DOES take
 * focus, so the keystrokes now land here first -- which makes the page the only thing
 * that can see them. It forwards each one as an intent (`opx:menu:key`) and waits to be
 * told what it meant, which is the same division of labour by a different route. The
 * repeat machine is gone with it: the browser's own key repeat is the same edge
 * detector, and `event.repeat` rides along so Lua can still tell a press from a hold.
 *
 * ── THE REFERENCE SURFACE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This file settled the look, so it is the one the rest of the runtime copies. It
 * carried a local frame, a local row, a local red ladder, a local ink shadow and a
 * local interlace while that was being settled; all five are in `design-system/` now
 * and this file keeps only what is true of a MENU.
 *
 * IT IS DRAWN BY AUGMENTED-UI, and the three reasons this file used to give for not
 * using it were checked against `node_modules/augmented-ui/augmented-ui.css` and two
 * of them were wrong:
 *
 *   1. "`--aug-border-bg` is one colour on four sides." It is assigned to
 *      `background`, so it takes a gradient, and the per-side WIDTHS are separate
 *      properties. The lit leading arete is `.op-arete`, a gradient across the
 *      border layer.
 *   2. "It spends both pseudo-elements." Only with both layers on. `::after` is the
 *      border and `::before` is the inlay, each `content: none` while its layer is
 *      off -- so asking for `border` alone leaves `::before` free, which is what
 *      `.op-interlace` uses here.
 *   3. "A clip shears an outset shadow." TRUE, and it is the one thing that changed:
 *      the chosen row's bloom is `.op-lift`, a `drop-shadow` that follows the cut.
 *
 * Nothing about the protocol changed. Same channels, same handle guard, same keys,
 * same `choose` intent. The player sees the same surface; it is drawn with four
 * fewer sprites and no local copy of anything.

/* =============================================================================
   THE MENU -- the reference surface, on the design system.

   This file settled the look, so it is the file the rest of the runtime copies.
   What it carried until now, and no longer does: four inline SVG frame sprites,
   its own copy of the red ladder, its own ink shadow, its own interlace
   gradient, its own perspective and tilt maths, its own stutter keyframes. All
   six were duplicated verbatim across ten other surfaces. They live in
   `design-system/` now and this file says only what is true of a MENU.

   THE LOOK IS UNCHANGED, deliberately and checkably: same three reds, same
   20px bay cut and 6px row cut, same 7deg tilt hinged on the anchored edge,
   same interlace, same stutter, same `--pop` step out of the column for the
   chosen row.

   WHAT THE SHAPES COST NOW. A row is `data-augmented-ui="tr-clip border"`: one
   attribute, and its state is `--aug-border-bg` plus `color`. Before, a row
   held a `border-image-source` pointing at one of four data URIs, each a copy
   of the same path, and `border-image-width: 8px` against a `border-width: 1px`
   so the corner tile would not shrink. The geometry is CSS now, so the cut size
   is a token rather than a redrawn sprite.

   THE ONE THING THAT HAD TO CHANGE. augmented-ui clips the element, and a clip
   shears an outset `box-shadow` along the diagonal -- so the chosen row's bloom
   is `.op-lift`, a `drop-shadow` that follows the cut. A filter is allowed here
   and forbidden on the HUD for the reason `shapes.css` gives: a menu repaints
   when a key is pressed, the vitals stream repaints thirty times a second.
