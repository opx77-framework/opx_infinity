/**
 * THE PANEL -- and, in practice, the fitting room, because nothing else opens one.
 *
 * The mouse-driven surface, and the resource the handle pattern was taken from: Lua
 * opens with a spec and keeps the handle, every payload in either direction carries it,
 * and a message whose handle is not the open one is dropped rather than applied.
 *
 * Three things the page decides for itself, and only these three, because none of them
 * is a fact about the world:
 *  - the search filter, over items Lua has already sent;
 *  - where the dial is standing, and therefore which slice of the list is drawn;
 *  - whether the confirm dialog is on screen.
 * Everything else is Lua's answer, applied verbatim. The panel does not select an item
 * because it was clicked; it says it was clicked and waits for `selected` to come back.
 *
 * ── WHAT THIS SCREEN IS, AND WHY IT IS LAID OUT LIKE THIS ───────────────────────────
 *
 * A player dressing a character is looking at the character. Everything here is
 * arranged around that one fact, which the previous layout did not concede: it filled
 * the screen with a scrim, put a 600px drawer down the middle-left with a title block
 * on top of it, and paged a two-column wall of names. The body was behind all of it.
 *
 * So: NO SCRIM -- the room is transparent and the player watches their own character
 * through it. NO HEADER -- the tab strip is the first thing in the column and it says
 * what the screen is by naming the seven slots, which is more than 'WARDROBE' ever
 * said. `eyebrow`, `title` and `subtitle` still arrive and are simply not drawn; that
 * is `MenuView`'s precedent for the same decision, and the cost is the same -- the
 * panel no longer names itself, and a second caller would have to live with that.
 * `intro` IS drawn, because it is the one of the four that states something the screen
 * cannot show: that nothing is kept until you save.
 *
 * ── THE DIAL, WHICH IS WHERE THE SLIDER WENT ────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Browsing a slot's pieces is one-dimensional and ordered, every step has a visible
 * consequence on the body, and the seam already carries a preview -- `hover` shows a
 * piece without choosing it and `select` chooses it. That is a slider, exactly: drag,
 * and the body wears what is under the thumb; let go, and that is your choice.
 * `@input` previews through the same debounced hover a pointer uses, `@change` commits.
 * A keyboard does both per arrow press, which is the behaviour you want.
 *
 * It replaced the pager, not the list. The list is still under the dial as a window
 * that follows the thumb, because a slider with no names beside it tells the player
 * nothing about where they are, and clicking a row is still the precise way to land on
 * one. `columns` keeps meaning what it meant: how many of that window sit abreast.
 *
 * ── THE RAIL, WHICH IS WHAT A `sliders` CALLER GETS ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A caller that sends `sliders` instead of items gets a different screen: the whole
 * left side of the surface, floor to ceiling, holding the view buttons, the other
 * screens reachable from this one, the categories, a scrolling grid of the open
 * category, and one track. The items column, the search plate and the paged window are
 * not drawn, because that caller kept its lists.
 *
 * WHAT IT REPLACED, AND WHY TWICE OVER. It was a bar of tracks along the bottom of the
 * screen. The owner, on the fitting room: "je le veux sur la gauche, plus en bas au
 * centre car cela cache le joueur", and then "tu peux prendre tout le cote gauche de
 * l'ecran". And on the picker: "mettre des box avec l'image du vetement uniquement, de
 * sorte a rendre le choix plus facile -- donc il scroll pour descendre et voir plus."
 * A grid the player scrolls needs height, and the bottom of the screen is where the
 * legs are.
 *
 * SEVEN TRACKS BECAME SEVEN TABS AND ONE TRACK. A tab strip exists to show one of
 * seven things at a time, which is exactly what a category picker is; a player
 * dressing a character is on one slot at a time anyway, and the mark on a closed tab
 * says whether that slot has anything on it. And `ui/README.md` rule 2 now points the
 * other way from the bar it replaced: a row of controls took no enclosure, but a
 * column that is the screen's whole left edge is a surface, so it keeps the `.op-bay`,
 * the `.op-arete` leading edge and the left hinge the items column has always had.
 *
 * THE GRID IS A WINDOW, NOT A LIST. The largest clothing category is 677 records and
 * the whole catalogue about 1968; streaming them as `items` is the defect the slider
 * was introduced to delete, and a grid that asked for all of them again would put it
 * straight back. The page holds the slice it has been sent and asks for the next one
 * on the way down. A box carries the index it would have had on the track, so a click
 * is the same `slide` a thumb sends and nothing new decides anything. See `Tiles`.
 *
 * AND THE TRACK STAYS, for the open category only. It is not leftover: sixty boxes at
 * a time means position 412 is seven windows of scrolling, while the track and the
 * number box beside it get there in one gesture -- and it is the control for a
 * category whose boxes are all monograms, which, until the garment pictures are
 * shipped, is every category.
 *
 * THE THUMB IS THE PAGE'S, THE INDEX IS THE CALLER'S. `@input` previews through a
 * debounce and `@change` commits, exactly as the dial does -- but a drag outruns the
 * answers, so the page holds its own position per slot while the player is on it and
 * lets the caller's index win again the moment they let go. That is how a refused
 * piece puts the thumb back: the caller answers with the index it still believes in.

    <!-- =====================================================================
         THE RAIL. The whole left side of the screen, floor to ceiling, for a
         caller that sent sliders.

         WHY THE LEFT SIDE AND NOT THE BOTTOM, which is where this was. The
         owner: "pour le menu de custom perso des vetements je le veux sur la
         gauche, plus en bas au centre car cela cache le joueur" -- and then,
         asked how much room it could have, "tu peux prendre tout le cote gauche
         de l'ecran". A bar along the bottom is the one place that cannot grow:
         a grid of garments needs HEIGHT to scroll in, and the bottom of the
         screen is where the body's legs are.

         AND THIS IS ALSO THE CAMERA DECISION, not a separate one. The obvious
         other half of "the panel takes the left" is "so move the character to
         the right", and on this build that cannot be done: `Open77.camera.detach`
         places the camera at an offset in the body's own space and frames the
         body from there, `Open77.camera.orbit` is a yaw inside the third-person
         rig, and neither takes an aim point -- the only native that would is the
         `camera.script` rig, which `config/appearance.lua` deliberately refuses
         to take a permission for in a clothing shop. A centred subject is what
         the fitting room gets. So the framing is settled HERE instead: the rail
         is bounded at `38vw` rather than half the screen, which on a 16:9 frame
         stops short of where a whole-body shot at 2.6 m begins. Widening this
         past the shot is the same bug as putting the panel over the body, in a
         different file.

               WHAT WAS BROKEN. They were four word-buttons in a `.tool-row`
               pinned to the bottom-right corner of the screen, laid out by
               `.tool { min-width: 78px }` inside a cluster that had its own
               plane, its own hinge and an `.is-end` mirror -- three coordinate
               systems for four buttons, in the one corner a centred bar reaches
               on a narrow screen. Two of the four were not even translated: the
               literal strings `left` and `right` went to the page in both
               languages. This is a rebuild and not a patch: one row, at the top
               of the one column, each button a square with the glyph over the
               word, and nothing positioned absolutely. -->

               IT IS NOT THE WHOLE CATEGORY. The page holds the window it has

/* =============================================================================
   THE RAIL: the whole left side of the screen.

   WHAT IT REPLACED. A bar of seven slider rows pinned along the bottom of the
   screen, with the camera buttons stacked above its right end. The owner's two
   messages settle both halves of the change: "je le veux sur la gauche, plus en
   bas au centre car cela cache le joueur", and "tu peux prendre tout le cote
   gauche de l'ecran". A bottom bar cannot hold a grid, because a grid needs
   height and the bottom of the screen is where the legs are.

   RULE 2 STILL APPLIES AND IT POINTS THE OTHER WAY NOW. The bar was a ROW of
   controls and took no enclosure. This is a column that HOLDS controls, a search
   of the screen's whole left edge, and the thing that says where it ends is the
   frame -- the same `.op-bay` the items column has carried all along, with the
   same `.op-arete` leading edge and the same +7deg hinge about the left edge.
   Rule 9's interlace still stays off: the body is behind this surface and
   stripes over it are the fill three passes have now removed.

   THE WIDTH IS THE CAMERA DECISION. `38vw` is not a taste: a whole-body shot at
   `CAMERA_OFFSET.Y = 2.6` puts the figure in the middle fifth of a 16:9 frame,
   and the camera cannot be told to aim anywhere else -- `Open77.camera.detach`
   takes a position and no aim point, `Open77.camera.orbit` is a yaw inside the
   third-person rig, and the one native that could is behind the `camera.script`
   permission `config/appearance.lua` refuses to take for a clothing shop. So the
   panel is what moves. `min(38vw, 620px)` keeps the right edge clear of the
   figure on every aspect ratio a player is likely to have, and `28rem` is the
   floor below which the grid stops fitting two boxes abreast.

   THE VIEW BUTTONS.

   A row of square picture buttons at the top of the rail, above everything that
   changes what the character wears. They are the only controls here that do not
   touch the clothes, so they read as a header rather than as the first category.

   WHY A GRID AND NOT A FLEX ROW. Four buttons of identical size is the whole
   affordance -- they are one instrument with four positions -- and a flex row
   sizes each one to its own word, so `Front` and `Right` came out different
   widths and the row read as four unrelated buttons. `repeat(4, 1fr)` is what
   makes them a set. The glyph is over the word and not beside it because the
   word is the caption: at this size the picture is what is scanned.

   NO `filter` ANYWHERE. `.op-lift` is a drop-shadow and these sit over a live
   3D view that repaints every frame. The state is the border, which is what
   `--aug-border-bg` is for. */
