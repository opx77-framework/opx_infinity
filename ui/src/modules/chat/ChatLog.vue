/**
 * THE CHAT LOG -- the overlay half of the box.
 *
 * Draws what was said and nothing else: it never takes a pointer, never takes the
 * keyboard, and has no way to send anything but its own `ready`. The input line is
 * `ChatInput.vue` on the modal layer.
 *
 * FADING IS A READ, NOT A TIMER PER LINE. Every line carries the moment it landed
 * and the template asks whether it is still young enough; one interval ticks a
 * clock while anything is still fading and stops when nothing is. Sixty lines with
 * sixty `setTimeout`s was the shape this replaced, and it leaked one per line
 * whenever the log was cleared.
 *
 * A line keeps its own kind. No colour ever travels on the wire: Lua sends
 * `kind: 'error'` and the tokens below decide what that looks like, so a palette
 * change does not have to chase values frozen into Lua months ago.

/* =============================================================================
   DESIGN PASS 02 -- RED, OUTLINED, TILTED. The chat log's half of it.

   This block draws on the overlay, so it takes the HUD's half of the pass
   rather than the menu's, and for the HUD's reason: IT HAS NO BACKING. Every
   line sits on live gameplay, which is why the two-pass black ink is declared
   once here and inherited by every line under it, and why there is no veil, no
   fill and no `backdrop-filter` -- the first version of this file had all three
   and read as a window pasted over the game.

   THE ERROR LINE IS NOT RED. Rule 4 of the contract: red is the voice of this
   surface, so it cannot also be its alarm. A red refusal among red author tags
   says nothing, so a refusal goes WHITE-HOT (`--alarm`) and changes family
   rather than shade. `--op77-danger` is not used here, exactly as it is not
   used anywhere in the HUD folder.

   NO FRAME. The log is a column of text and not a cluster: the HUD's clusters
   that carry a `border-image` are the ones with something to enclose. What
   marks this one is a single lit arete down the leading edge -- the same
   1px red rule a menu row uses at rest -- and nothing else.

     Quiet rather than full strength, and for the reason the token gives: this is
     up to sixty lines tall while the box is open, which is a quarter of the
     screen, and a quarter of the screen at 0.78 is a window pasted over the game
     -- the exact thing the veil and the `backdrop-filter` were removed to avoid.
