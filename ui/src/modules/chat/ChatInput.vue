 * overlay layer and never sees any of this.
 *
 * WHAT LEAVES HERE IS A CANDIDATE, NOT A DECISION. `submit` carries the typed line
 * and Lua decides what it is: a message, a command, or a line it refuses to tokenise.
 * This file knows exactly one thing about the difference -- a line starting with `/`
 * gets the completion list -- and nothing about commands, permissions or arguments.
 *
 * FOCUS IS TAKEN ON `focus`, NOT ON `open`. Lua publishes the two in that order and
 * the order is load-bearing: the element focus has to land in a surface that already
 * holds the keyboard, or the caret goes nowhere and the player types into the game.
 *
 * Escape is handled by the focus stack rather than by a key listener here, so that a
 * box opened over something else gives focus back to that something and not to
 * nobody.

/* =============================================================================
   DESIGN PASS 02 -- RED AND OUTLINED. The input line's half of it.

   Unlike the log, this half IS a cluster: it encloses something, it takes the
   keyboard, and it is the only part of the chat a player drives. So it takes the
   menu's half of the pass rather than the HUD's -- a 9-slice frame and the lit
   rung while it holds focus.

   NOT TILTED, AND THAT IS THE ONE PLACE THIS FILE LEAVES THE PASS. The name of
   the pass says TILTED and every other surface obeys it; this one does not,
   because it is the surface the player TYPES INTO. A `rotateY` resamples every
   glyph the caret sits between, and a line being composed has to be the sharpest
   text on screen rather than the most styled. The precedent is already in the
   tree: `FormView.vue` and `InventoryView.vue` both take `--tilt: 0deg` for the
   neighbouring reason, and the first version of this file leaned at 7deg and was
   rejected on sight.

   THE FRAME IS `border-image`, NOT `clip-path`. A clip cuts the painted result,
   so a bordered box under one loses its stroke along the diagonal and the
   chamfer arrives as a GAP rather than a cut corner. A state change swaps
   `border-image-source` -- one property -- and the geometry never distorts with
   the element's width, which matters here because the box is as wide as the
   operator configured it.
