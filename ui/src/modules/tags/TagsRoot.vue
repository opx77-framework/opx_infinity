/**
 * THE NAME TAGS -- who is standing there, drawn over their head.
 *
 * TWO CHANNELS, AND THEY RUN AT VERY DIFFERENT SPEEDS. That is the whole shape of
 * this file:
 *
 *   `opx:admin:tags`   WHAT to draw. One payload when the frame changes, which is
 *                      a handful of times a minute: a player walked into range, a
 *                      name arrived, the operator switched them off.
 *   `open77:anchors`   WHERE to draw it. The host projects every anchor on every
 *                      game frame and publishes the batch to this surface, so a
 *                      tag follows a running body without anything crossing the
 *                      Lua tick.
 *
 * They are joined by the ANCHOR ID, which `modules/admin/client/tagsview.lua`
 * puts on every row. A row whose anchor is absent from the batch is NOT DRAWN:
 * the host's own words are that the batch is the complete set and an id missing
 * from it is behind the camera, out of the distance band, or its body is not
 * streamed. Holding the last coordinate would leave a tag pinned to the sky where
 * someone used to be.
 *
 * THE COORDINATES ARE NORMALISED, 0..1, top-left origin -- the platform's
 * convention for every screen coordinate it hands a page. They are multiplied by
 * the viewport here and never stored in pixels: the surface is 1920x1080 and the
 * game window is not.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE TAKES A POINTER OR THE KEYBOARD. It is on the overlay layer, which
 * is `pointer-events: none` for the whole layer, and this file does not re-enable
 * it -- a name tag that captured the keyboard would stop the player moving.
 *
 * -- DESIGN PASS 02 -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * A MARKER AND SOME TYPE. An id square on the left, drawn by augmented-ui with
 * the chamfer and the lit ground every control in the runtime wears, and the
 * names to the right of it wearing nothing at all.
 *
 * THE NAMES USED TO HAVE A PLATE and it has been taken off, on the owner's
 * instruction and for a reason that holds: nine tags on a street corner were
 * nine filled rectangles over the world, and the thing making the lettering
 * legible was never the ground -- it was the ink shadow on `.tag`, which is
 * still there and whose own comment always said so. Rule 2 of the contract
 * gives a closed box to what can be pressed; nothing on this layer can be
 * pressed. The square keeps its box because a square with an id in it IS a
 * marker. The names beside it are type.
 *
 * The square is centred against the column rather than sitting on its first
 * line. It rode the top edge while there was a plate for its corners to break;
 * with no edge to meet, a marker beside a block of type sits level with the
 * block's middle.
 *
 * It is NOT tilted, and that needs no argument: a tag is pinned to a body in the
 * world, and the world is already supplying its perspective.
 *
 * THREE NAMES, ONE PER LINE. They were on one line until the owner asked for the
 * column, and the column is the better shape for a reason worth keeping: three
 * runs abreast make a tag as wide as a body is tall, and at any distance the
 * whole thing is a smear with a name somewhere in it. Stacked, a tag is the width
 * of its widest run, and the eye reads down it the way it reads a label.
 *
 * They are still not three equal things, and the RANKING is what stops a column
 * from reading as a list of three addresses. It is carried by three dimensions at
 * once rather than by size alone:
 *
 *   THE CHARACTER   display face, uppercase, the brightest red. It is what the
 *                   city calls this person and it is the only run meant to be read
 *                   at distance. Everything else is for somebody who has already
 *                   walked up.
 *   THE ACCOUNT     mono, smaller, dimmer, and NOT uppercased -- an account name is
 *                   typed by its owner and casing is part of it.
 *   THE CITIZEN ID  mono, smallest, tracked wide, dimmest. It is a code and it is
 *                   read one symbol at a time, which is what the tracking is for.
 *
 * THE LINE BREAK IS THE SEPARATOR, and nothing is drawn on top of it. On one
 * line the runs were divided by a 1px hairline at 45% height -- a pause rather
 * than a glyph, because a bullet or a slash would be a fourth thing to read at a
 * name's weight. Turned on its side for a column that rule becomes a full-width
 * hairline, which reads as the plate being divided into CELLS: exactly what the
 * vertical one was shaped to avoid. So it is gone rather than rotated. This
 * surface still has no punctuation on it anywhere.
 *
 * A RUN THAT IS EMPTY DRAWS NOTHING -- a tag over somebody still loading is the
 * name and the square, and the plate shrinks back to the one-line strip it was.
 *
 * `TAGS.COLORS` IN `config/admin.lua` IS NOT READ. It is `#F2F6F8` / `#FCEE0A` /
 * `#22D8E2` / `#0A1220`: the pass-01 palette, and `.op-theme-city` turns the
 * accent Night City yellow. Pass 02 is one hue and bans both. The fields still
 * cross the bridge and still have their config entries -- the same standing this
 * tree gives `payload.eyebrow` in `HudInfo.vue` and `row.hold` in
 * `PromptsRoot.vue` -- because a page changing its mind does not change Lua's
 * contract. If an operator ever needs the colour back it is a palette on `.tags`,
 * not four literals through the wire.

   THE SHAPE THE OWNER ASKED FOR: "a square on the left with the id, then to the
   right of the square -- letting the square's corners stick out a little -- the
   player's name". So the square is TALLER than the plate beside it and sits over
   its leading edge: four corners break the plate's outline, which is what makes
   the pair read as one object with a marker on it rather than as two boxes that
   happen to touch.

     re-eases from a standstill on every new value and reads as rubber; linear
     just draws the line. 70ms because it is about four frames -- long enough to
     bridge a gap, short enough that the tag is never visibly behind the head it
