/**
 * THE SPAWN MENU -- where a character starts.
 *
 * Offered on a world enter the operator's policy says to ask about. Lua opens it with
 * the places to draw and a duration, and the page answers with the ID of one of them;
 * the place itself is the server's to look up, so nothing here can move anybody
 * anywhere the server has not already agreed to. Picking nothing is a real answer --
 * the server places the body where the character's own row already says -- which is
 * why nothing here insists on one.
 *
 * ONE PRESS IS THE CHOICE. Clicking a card sends it -- you do not select and then
 * confirm, because "spawn me at the coast" is one intent and asking for it twice is
 * a menu pretending the first click did not count. The arrow keys plus Enter take the
 * same route, so the two input paths cannot drift apart.
 *
 * SO THERE IS NO CONFIRM CONTROL, and there was one. It sat under the grid and did
 * exactly what a click already did: a second control for an intent the first press
 * had already sent. It read as a step -- pick, then press SPAWN -- which is the one
 * thing the whole surface is built not to be, and a player who had clicked a card and
 * then looked at a lit button reasonably wondered whether the click had counted. It
 * existed for the keyboard; Enter goes straight to `confirm()` instead.
 *
 * AND NO CLOCK. The page used to draw the window counting down beside the title. It
 * was display only -- it reached zero and did nothing, because the server counts the
 * same window against its own clock and only that count ends the choice -- so all it
 * ever did was put a deadline in front of somebody making a one-press decision. The
 * duration is not sent to this page any more; running out is still handled, on
 * `spawn:close` with `reason = 'timeout'`, which is where it always was.
 *
 * THE MENU DOES NOT CLOSE ON THAT PRESS. It closes when Lua says so -- `spawn:close`,
 * carrying what actually happened -- for the same reason a panel does not select its
 * own item: a page that closed itself would show the player a spawn the server
 * refused, and there is no second chance at this one. The one thing this page decides
 * for itself is which card is highlighted, and that is a receipt for a press already
 * sent rather than a fact about the world.
 *
 * ── THE RESTYLE ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * This file arrived written against `design/components/*` -- `OpPanel`, `OpRow`,
 * `OpScrim` -- and against the `--op77-*` token set. Neither exists: the shared row
 * components were what coupled five surfaces together in pass 01 and were deleted
 * with it, and the tokens are `--op-*` now. The import alone broke the build, so
 * this is not a restyle of a working page; it is a page that could not be bundled.
 *
 * What it is drawn out of instead is the vocabulary every other surface uses:
 * `.op-bay` for the enclosure, `.op-frame` for a card, `.op-arete` for the lit
 * leading run, `.op-interlace` over what is enclosed, `.op-lift` for the chosen
 * card's bloom, `.op-plane` for the perspective. Per `ui/README.md`, a shape is
 * augmented-ui and a state is one `--aug-border-bg`; NOTHING here writes an accent
 * channel as a literal, because the accent is the operator's -- `design-system/theme.ts`
 * overwrites the triples on `:root` at runtime and a copied `rgba(...)` would simply
 * not follow.
 *
 * A CENTRED SURFACE TAKES NO TILT. `.op-plane > *` defaults `--op-tilt-signed` to
 * 0deg and this page adds no anchor class, so the stage does not rotate: turning a
 * centred plane about its own middle is paper on a spindle, which is the call
 * `FormView` and `InventoryView` both make.

/* =============================================================================
   THE SPAWN MENU -- red, outlined, untilted.

   `MenuView.vue` settled the look and `FormView.vue` is that look centred behind
   a scrim, which is what this surface is: one bounded enclosure the player drives
   with the pointer or with four keys, over a world they cannot touch yet. So this
   file takes the bay, the arete, the interlace and the frame from
   `design-system/` and says only what is true of a SPAWN MENU:

     1. IT IS A GRID, NOT A COLUMN. Eleven places read as a map at two abreast and
        as a scroll at one; a menu strip's single column would put the last four
        below the fold of a 1080p surface, and the whole point of the screen is to
        see the choices at once.
     2. THE CHOSEN CARD DOES NOT STEP OUT OF THE COLUMN. `--op-pop` is a lateral
        move away from the anchored edge, and this surface is anchored to none --
        there is no edge for it to step away from, and in a grid it would shunt a
        card into its neighbour. The frame, the ground and the bloom carry the
        state instead, which is `.op-frame.is-on` plus `.op-lift` and nothing local.
     3. THERE IS NO TILT. A centred plane rotated about its own middle sends half
        toward the player and half away. `.op-plane` gives the perspective and the
        containment; no anchor class means `--op-tilt-signed` stays 0deg.

   EVERY COLOUR IS A TOKEN. The accent is the server's -- `modules/theme` sends
   the triples and `design-system/theme.ts` writes them onto `:root` -- so an
   `rgba(232, 67, 79, ...)` written here would be the one surface that ignored an
   operator's accent, with nothing to warn anybody. The only literals below are
   black: the scrim's own ground comes from `--op-plate-quiet` and the ink from
   `--op-ink`.
   ========================================================================== */

/* The wash under the menu. The same one `FormView` draws, and for the same
   reason: this surface takes the cursor and the keyboard, so the world behind it
   has to stop looking like something the player can still act on. `--op-plate-quiet`
   is the house ground at its lightest weight, so a theme that darkens the surface
   darkens this with it. */
