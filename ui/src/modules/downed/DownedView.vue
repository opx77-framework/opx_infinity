/**
 * THE DOWN SCREEN -- what a player sees while they are bleeding out, and the two
 * ways off it.
 *
 * `modules/downed` has owned this since it was written and has never had a
 * surface: the Lua half publishes `config`, `show`, `hide`, `notice` and `focus`
 * on one seam and takes `ready`, `wait`, `giveUp`, `key` and `diag` back through
 * another, and there was nothing on either end. A player who died got their
 * input taken away, the whole stock HUD hidden, and a black screen. This is that
 * missing end, and it is one channel -- `opx:downed:view` -- carrying a `kind`,
 * because that is the shape the seam already had.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE DECIDES ANYTHING, which is the same sentence `ProgressRoot.vue`
 * opens with and means something sharper on this surface: the two controls are a
 * respawn and a distress call, and both are the server's to grant. WAIT emits an
 * intent. GIVE UP does not even emit a decision -- it reports the state of a
 * BUTTON, down and still down and let go, and `client/main.lua` times the press
 * against its own clock and the server re-checks the two-minute delay against
 * its own. A page that lied about any of it would be arguing with two clocks it
 * cannot reach.
 *
 * EVERY WORD ON IT COMES FROM LUA. The seventeen keys under `medic.` are read
 * out of the active catalogue and handed over in the `config` payload, so this
 * file holds no English and no French; a key with no string renders AS the key,
 * which is loudly wrong on purpose (see `composables/useLocale`).
 *
 * -- WHAT IS TIMED, AND HOW ------------------------------------------------
 *
 * THREE CLOCKS, NONE OF THEM AUTHORITATIVE, and every one of them fed by a
 * DEADLINE rather than by a value Lua repeats:
 *
 *   the two-minute lock  `giveUpInMs` once, turned into an instant, counted down
 *                        by `useCountdown` and stopped dead at zero. Lua is
 *                        counting the same window and only its count unlocks
 *                        anything -- reaching zero here only stops drawing the
 *                        word "locked".
 *   DOWN FOR             `downForMs` once, turned into the instant the player
 *                        fell, and counted UP at 1Hz because it is drawn as
 *                        mm:ss and a faster tick would repaint the same two
 *                        digits.
 *   the 1.5s hold        a CSS transition of exactly `holdMs`, started on the
 *                        press. The browser interpolates it on the compositor,
 *                        so the fill is smooth whatever the page's frame rate is
 *                        doing, and nothing about the picture is on the wire.
 *
 * NOTHING ON THIS SURFACE CARRIES A FILTER, and that is not an oversight: two of
 * those clocks repaint while the player looks at them and the third repaints
 * every frame it fills. `.op-lift` is a `drop-shadow`, a filter gives the element
 * its own backing store, and a backing store re-rasterised on a ticking
 * countdown is the one thing `design-system/shapes.css` says never to do. The
 * chosen state is carried by `.op-frame.is-on` alone.

   It is `SpawnView`'s room -- a centred plane, one bay -- because it is
   the same kind of surface: a full-screen question the player cannot walk away
   from, over a world they may not touch. What is different is the weight. A
   spawn menu is offered; this is the end of a life, so the wash is heavier, the
   title is the hero size, and the instruments above the controls are there to
   say that the body is still being measured.

   NO TILT: a centred plane rotated about its own middle is paper on a spindle,
   so the stage carries `.op-plane` and no `.op-anchor-*`.

   NO FILTER, ANYWHERE. Two readouts tick while the player watches them and the
   charge repaints every frame it fills; `.op-lift` would give each its own
   backing store to re-rasterise. The chosen state is `.op-frame.is-on` alone.
