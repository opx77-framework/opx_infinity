/**
 * TOASTS -- the port of `opx77_notify/web/{index.html,notify.js,notify.css}`.
 *
 * THE PAGE OWNS THE CLOCK, and that is not a style choice here: `core/client/notify.lua`
 * has no expiry loop at all. It raises a toast carrying its whole lifetime, keeps the id
 * so it can address the toast later, and waits for this page to say the toast has gone.
 * If this module never emits `notify:gone`, Lua's `live` table grows for the session and
 * a dismiss aimed at a toast that left the screen minutes ago does nothing.
 *
 * WHY A TIMER AND NOT `requestAnimationFrame`, which is what notify.js used: rAF is
 * paced by painting, and a CEF surface that is throttled or not compositing stops
 * painting. Under notify.js that only stalled a progress bar, because Lua was counting
 * too and Lua removed the toast. Here a stalled clock is a toast that never expires and
 * never reports, so the countdown runs on a timer, which fires whether or not the
 * surface drew.
 *
 * WHY `useCountdown` IS NOT USED: it is display-only by contract -- it deliberately does
 * not fire a callback at zero, because a countdown on this platform is normally a smooth
 * animation of a deadline the server is also counting. This one IS the authority, so it
 * needs the one thing that composable refuses to do.
 *
 * ── THE STINGERS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A toast may carry two clips, and they are the reason this page owns the reveal as
 * well as the clock. `open` plays first and the message is HELD until it ends: the
 * toast is live and addressable by Lua, and it is not drawn, and its lifetime has not
 * begun -- a message that is not on screen is not being read. `close` plays once the
 * message has gone, which is why it starts after the exit transition rather than with
 * it. A toast dismissed while still held plays neither: nothing ever appeared.
 *
 * NO STINGER IS EVER LOAD-BEARING. The clip helper answers on a deadline and on every
 * failure, so a missing file, a decoder that refuses it and a machine that will not
 * play audio all end the same way -- with the message drawn.
 *
 * ── DESIGN PASS 02 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THIS MODULE DRAWS ITS OWN TOAST. `design/components/OpToast.vue` had exactly one
 * consumer -- this file -- and is still there, untouched: `ui/src/design/**` is closed
 * until the pass lands, and `MenuView.vue` set the precedent when it dropped `OpPanel`
 * and `OpRow` for local copies. `NotifyToast.vue` beside this file is that copy, and it
 * says in place what it kept and what it refused. Nothing else on the page imported
 * `OpToast`, so nothing else moved.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE OWNS OF THE LOOK: the seven stacks, which is where the PLANE lives.
 * A stack is the positioned wrapper, so it carries the perspective and names the screen
 * edge it is anchored to; the toast tilts because its entry does. Nothing about the
 * protocol changed -- same channels, same clock, same `notify:gone`.
