/**
 * ONE TOAST -- design pass 02.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT `design/components/OpToast.vue`. It was, and that component is
 * still there untouched. Pass 02 is agreed on the menu surface only, and
 * `MenuView.vue` says what to do about that in as many words: it dropped `OpPanel`
 * and `OpRow` for local copies "because those two are shared... and changing them
 * changes every surface at once", and the local copy is deleted when the pass is
 * promoted into `design/`. `OpToast` has exactly one consumer -- this module -- so
 * nothing else moves when it is left behind, and the same rule applies for the same
 * reason: `ui/src/design/**` is off limits until the pass lands.
 *
 * WHAT CAME ACROSS FROM IT, unchanged: the shape (a leading icon column, a body, a
 * 2px lifetime bar), the `progress` contract (0..1, or -1 for "draw no bar", set by
 * width and never by a keyframe, because the bar tracks a deadline Lua is also
 * counting), and the rule that severity is one variable and moves as little as
 * possible. What did not: the fill, `data-augmented-ui`, `op-panel`, `op-lift`, the
 * `--op77-notch-clip` shape, and `--op77-accent` -- which `.op-theme-city` makes
 * Night City yellow on <html>, and pass 02 bans yellow outright.
 *
 * THE ICON IS A GLYPH NOW, not a text badge. `OpToast` took "up to a few characters
 * of caller text", which is what the PLATFORM's own notification package means by
 * `icon` (a short badge, at most 16 bytes). This surface is not that package: it is
 * our page, fed by `core/client/notify.lua`, so `icon` here is a name from the
 * closed glyph set and Lua refuses a toast naming anything outside it.

/**
 * THE KIND, IN WORDS. Rule 8 of the pass: technical filler is content, and a
 * micro-label has to state something the surface actually knows. The kind is the
 * one thing every toast knows about itself, and now that toasts are the runtime's
 * only channel for "that worked" / "that failed" it is the thing a player most
 * needs off a glance -- so it is said outright rather than left to be inferred
 * from a frame's weight.
 *
 * A catalogue key first, because the page holds no English (see `useLocale`). The
 * fallback is not a sentence, it is a four-character mono tag of the same class as
 * `FormView`'s `FORM`, and it exists so this reads correctly before anyone adds
 * `notify.kind.*` to `locales/`. `has` rather than `t` alone: `t` renders a missing
 * key AS the key, and `notify.kind.error` in the tag slot would be worse than
 * nothing.

/* =============================================================================
   ONE TOAST, on the design system.

   WHAT THIS FILE USED TO CARRY and no longer does: five inline SVG data URIs,
   one per kind plus a spare, each a copy of the same chamfer path with one
   stroke value changed; its own copy of the red ladder; its own ink shadow; its
   own interlace gradient. All four now come from `design-system/`, and this file
   says only what is TRUE OF A TOAST.

   RED IS THE VOICE, SO RED CANNOT BE THE ALARM -- and a toast has four kinds,
   which is the hard version of that problem. A second saturated hue is not
   available: two hues on an unfilled red surface over live gameplay is the
   yellow-accent mistake with extra steps. So the kinds are told apart on three
   axes already in the language, and a fourth that is words:

     1. TONE SAYS WHETHER SOMETHING IS WRONG. Red for `info` and `success`,
        white-hot for `warning` and `error`. White already means "something is
        wrong" everywhere in this runtime, so success must never take it.
     2. WEIGHT SAYS HOW LOUD. The border climbs 1px -> 1px -> 1.6px -> 2.4px,
        and only `error` blooms.
     3. LIT VERSUS AT REST SEPARATES THE TWO QUIET KINDS. `info` wears the
        resting arete every frame in the runtime wears; `success` is lit.
     4. AND THE KIND IS SAID IN WORDS, because the three above are read at a
        glance and a glance is all a toast gets.

   THE BLOOM IS A FILTER HERE, and that is a change forced by the shape. An
   outset `box-shadow` is cut off along the chamfer by the element's own clip,
   so `error` takes `.op-lift`, whose `drop-shadow` follows the cut. The rule
   that forbids filters is about elements that repaint every frame; a toast
   changes when Lua says something happened.
