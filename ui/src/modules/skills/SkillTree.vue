/**
 * THE SKILL TREE -- seven trunks of job work, thirty-five nodes, and the one
 * currency a level banks.
 *
 * IT DECIDES NOTHING, the way no view here does. Which trunks exist, how deep
 * each has been fed, which nodes are yours and what a press would cost all
 * arrive from the server; this page draws the frame and reports presses. An
 * unlock is an INTENT (`skills:spend`) and the tree only redraws when a fresh
 * frame comes back -- a node bought in the page would be a second authority
 * over one fact.
 *
 * STOWING IS AN INTENT TOO. The close control, Escape and the stow key all ask
 * (`skills:close`, deduped like a spend); the panel goes down when the close
 * comes back on `skills:view`, exactly as the scanner waits for its own. The
 * tree is a MODAL and holds the keyboard, and on this platform no key mapping
 * fires while a page does -- so the stow key (the player's own binding, which
 * the frame carries) is caught HERE and asked for like any other close.
 *
 * -- WHY IT WAS REBUILT: "not showing all the skills, the page isn't big enough" --
 *
 * Both halves were true. The panel was `min(980px, ...)` at every surface size
 * -- the same small box at 1280 and at 2560 -- and each trunk got a ~305px
 * column of it. In that column a LOCKED row was `[ord][mark][name][why]` with
 * the name at `flex: 1` (basis 0) and the requirement sentence at its whole
 * width (~280px at the micro size), so the name was laid out at ZERO px and
 * the sentence cut: every locked node's name was 0px wide at 1280x720,
 * 1920x1080 and 2560x1440, in both languages.
 *
 * -- DESIGN, per ui/README.md, after the game's own PERKS screen --
 *
 * ONE SURFACE, SCALED WHOLE, NEVER REFLOWED. The tree is laid out on a
 * 1280x720 design surface and `transform: scale` takes it to the largest size
 * the screen holds -- 1.5x at 1080p, 2x at 1440p -- which is how the game
 * scales its own menus. Every one of the thirty-five nodes is on screen at
 * every 16:9 size from 720p up. The fit is a function of the window alone (no
 * measured element, so no loop between a size and the scale that reads it).
 * Another aspect ratio gets its spare room as LAYOUT, never as a smaller tree;
 * below 1280x720 the scale stays at 1 and the room scrolls, because shrinking
 * past the type scale buys a tree nobody can read.
 *
 * A TREE GROWS UP. Trunks are COLUMNS, in the config's order, and ranks are
 * ROWS from rank 1 at the foot to the capstones at the crown -- the game's
 * attribute gates (4 / 9 / 15 / 20) turned on end, with a gate on each row.
 * Each trunk's head is its ROOT, under its column: emblem, name, the work that
 * feeds it, its rank drawn and said, and its step toward the next. The node
 * at index i is the rank-i node: the server's own `rankOf`, so the row says
 * what the frame says.
 *
 * THE LAST TRUNK IS THE APEX. The config orders the trunks and the last one is
 * drawn as the top of the tree -- its column edged, its root framed and named
 * as the apex -- and its last node, the highest a character can climb, is the
 * legend: the one tile that stays lit even while it is locked, because it is
 * the goal the whole screen points at. No id is special-cased here.
 *
 * EACH TRUNK HAS ITS OWN MARK: its emblem and its feed line come from the
 * frame (config `ICON` / `FEED`), and a node's glyph is its perk's, falling
 * back to its trunk's emblem -- identity by picture and words, never by a
 * second hue (rule 7).
 *
 * CENTRED, so there is NO TILT (rule 5).
 *
 * A NODE THE WORK HAS NOT REACHED IS A READOUT, NOT A CONTROL (rule 2): no
 * closed frame and no ground -- four corner brackets around its name, and a
 * short line STATING ITS REQUIREMENT (the rank, the node below it, or the
 * points, restated from the server's own `why`; the whole sentence is in the
 * detail column). It is still pressable, because a readout you cannot ask
 * about is half a readout: a press INSPECTS and never offers the unlock. The
 * unlock is the one control, and it is only ever on a node the server called
 * `available`.
 *
 * THE WIRES ARE THE RANK, DRAWN UP THE TRUNK: idle red as far as its work has
 * reached, full red between claimed nodes, a dashed hairline past it.
 *
 * THE DETAIL COLUMN IS ALWAYS THERE, as the game's is: the name large, the
 * description with the perk's value lit (cut at the locale template's own
 * `{value}` -- the page never writes the sentence), the perk id, value, cost,
 * tier and trunk, the server's sentence for the state, and the one control.
 * With nothing picked it lists what the points can buy now.
 *
 * THE CHROME BAND is `frame.chrome` and `frame.cap`, both optional: a server
 * that sends neither gets the tree and no band. Every figure in it is the
 * frame's; the one number the page derives, the average gain per level, is
 * (at the cap - at level 1) / (cap - 1) of frame numbers, and says so.
 *
 * EVERY MICRO-LABEL STATES A REAL NUMBER (rule 8): gate ranks, each trunk's
 * rank and XP, node costs, the picked node's place in its trunk, the header's
 * level, XP, points and ready count. The buyable count is counted off the
 * frame's own node states -- nothing on this surface is a number the frame did
 * not carry or the page cannot count off it.
 *
 * NO TITLE. The screen does not name itself: the header opens on the level
 * and the chrome band on its figures. A "SKILL TREE" banner over a skill tree,
 * a trunk-and-node tally under it and a sentence explaining the band read as
 * filler, not as the game's UI (2026-09-28), and went.
 *
 * FRESHNESS IS THE HUE'S LUMINANCE DESCENT (rule 4): the ledger line is the
 * voice at full (`--op-red`) when it is news a player looks up for -- a level,
 * a node claimed -- and work credited settles at `--op-text-dim`.
 *
 * THE ENTRANCE IS THE STAGGER (`.op-enter` with `--op-slot`): roots first,
 * then the tiles climbing, so the tree grows in. A FRESH frame also sweeps the
 * detail column clean, and brings a tree taller than the screen to its roots.
