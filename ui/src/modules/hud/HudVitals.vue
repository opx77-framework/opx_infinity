/**
 * THE VITALS COLUMN -- health, armour, stamina, hunger, thirst.
 *
 * THE ONE HOT CHANNEL ON THIS SURFACE. `opx:hud:vitals` is a numeric stream at roughly
 * the surface's 30 Hz, and the store is a `shallowRef` REPLACED WHOLESALE for exactly
 * that reason: `ref([])` over five rows of five fields is twenty-five reactive
 * dependencies re-validated thirty times a second to move five numbers, and Vue's deep
 * proxy would be walking a fresh array of fresh objects on every frame to discover that
 * all of it is new. One dependency, one assignment, one render.
 *
 * Nothing below decides what is low. `tone` arrives decided: Lua holds the thresholds
 * because Lua holds the configuration, and a page that coloured its own gauge would be
 * a second opinion about the player's health.
 *
 * -- DESIGN PASS 02 -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * THE GAUGE IS DRAWN HERE NOW. It was `OpGauge`, and OpGauge is shared with the voice
 * meter, the panel module and anything else that grows a meter -- so changing it changes
 * surfaces nobody has looked at yet. This folder carries its own while the pass is being
 * settled, exactly as MenuView.vue carries its own frame and row, and for the same
 * reason: a duplicate nobody has agreed to keep is the cheapest thing to delete.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED INSIDE IT, and both changes are performance before they are style:
 *
 *   1. TWENTY SEGMENTS BECAME ONE BAR. A gauge's fill is DATA, so it is the one filled
 *      shape the contract leaves standing -- but its track and its frame are outlines.
 *      The segment count Lua configures did not go anywhere: it is drawn as hairline
 *      graduations ON the track, one static gradient, instead of as N live boxes.
 *      OpGauge changed `background` on up to twenty leaf nodes per gauge per frame;
 *      five gauges at 30 Hz is three thousand fill repaints a second to move five
 *      numbers.
 *   2. THE BAR MOVES BY `transform`, never by `width`. `scaleX` on a composited layer
 *      costs no layout and no repaint at all; a `width` in percent costs both, on the
 *      hottest element of the hottest channel on the surface. This is the single
 *      biggest saving in the folder.
