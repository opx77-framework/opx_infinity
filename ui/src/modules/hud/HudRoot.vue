/**
 * THE HUD -- the port of `opx77_hud/web/{index.html,hud.js,hud.css}`.
 *
 * This file owns the LAYOUT and nothing else: where each block sits, and whether the HUD
 * is on screen at all. Every block below subscribes to its own channel and holds its own
 * state, which is the split that matters on this surface -- the vitals stream runs at
 * roughly 30 Hz and the money line changes when the player is paid. One `opx:hud:frame`
 * carrying both, as hud.js had, means re-rendering the street cred thirty times a second
 * to move a health bar.
 *
 * HIDDEN IS NOT UNMOUNTED. `open` is an opacity, exactly as `body.open` was in hud.css: a
 * block taken out of layout replays its entrance when it comes back, and every clock
 * under here keeps running while it is off screen, so what comes back is current rather
 * than a frame from before the player went down.
 *
 * DEFAULT VISIBLE. There is no Lua module behind `opx:hud:config` or `opx:hud:show` yet.
 * A HUD that waited for permission to draw would be a black screen until someone wrote
 * one, and on the surface that "must not stop drawing for any reason" the safe default is
 * on. Lua turns it off; Lua does not have to turn it on.
 *
 * -- DESIGN PASS 02 -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * THIS FILE IS NO LONGER THE HUD'S PALETTE, and that is the point of the port. It
 * carried the three red steps, the alarm, five 9-slice frame sprites and the ink
 * shadow, because a scoped rule cannot reach into a child component and a custom
 * property on `.hud` can. Every one of those is a `design-system/` token now, which
 * the five blocks read the same way and which eleven other surfaces read too -- so
 * the HUD stopped being a second place where the voice of the runtime is decided.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL DECLARED HERE is what is true of THIS cluster and nothing else: the
 * bleed its wrappers need, the interlace its two enclosed blocks share, and the
 * layout below.
 *
 * NO FILTERS IN THIS FOLDER, with one written exception. A filter gives an element
 * its own backing store, and the vitals stream repaints thirty times a second; the
 * exception is `HudVoice`'s rx counter, which appears when somebody talks rather
 * than on a clock, and which needs a bloom that follows a cut corner.
 *
 * THE INK SHADOW IS ONE DECLARATION. `text-shadow` inherits, and this surface has no
 * backing of any kind, so every glyph under `.hud` -- in every block -- is carried by the
 * pair below. A block that wants a red bloom on a word restates BOTH passes plus the
 * bloom, because an override replaces the whole list.

/* =============================================================================
   DESIGN PASS 02 -- RED, OUTLINED, TILTED. The HUD's half of it.

   The menu settled the language and this folder takes it. What is different
   about the HUD, and what every decision below turns on:

     * IT REPAINTS CONTINUOUSLY. A menu changes when a key is pressed; the
       vitals stream is ~30 Hz and the speedometer moves whenever the car does.
       So the rules that are advisory on a menu are load-bearing here: no
       `filter` on anything whose value changes, no fill that has to be
       re-rasterised, and a moving quantity moves by `transform` -- the one
       thing the compositor can do without a repaint at all.
     * IT HAS NO BACKING WHATSOEVER. Not even the menu's veil dial is raised.
       Every glyph sits on live gameplay, which is why `text-shadow` is
       declared once here and inherited by all five blocks.
     * IT IS FIVE CLUSTERS, NOT ONE SURFACE. Each is anchored to a different
       screen edge, so each gets its own tilt sign -- and the one Lua anchors
       to a centre gets none.
   ========================================================================== */
