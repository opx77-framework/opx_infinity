/**
 * THE VOICE BLOCK -- bottom-right corner, on the same insets as every anchored cluster.
 *
 * IT WAS MID-RIGHT, AND THE MIDDLE OF AN EDGE IS THE WORST PLACE A BLOCK OF THIS SHAPE
 * CAN SIT. Vertically centred, a 52-to-220px column of mic, meter, mode, pips, keycaps
 * and counter lands exactly at eye level -- over the road, over the crosshair's
 * neighbours, over whatever the player is actually looking at -- and it is the one
 * block on this HUD that is TALLER THAN IT IS WIDE, so at eye level it is a stripe
 * across the middle of the view rather than a read-out in a corner. Every other cluster
 * already reads its own corner. This one now does too.
 *
 * The corner is `bottom-right`, and for two reasons it is that one and not `bottom-left`:
 * the block is right-anchored (its chamfers, its lit arete and the sign of its tilt all
 * follow the right edge, and `railOf` has answered `end` for it since the port), and
 * voting in `HudRoot.vue` puts the vitals column and the chip strip in the bottom-left
 * and the vehicle chip at the bottom centre -- so the bottom-right was the free corner
 * on an already-full edge.
 *
 * Lua decides the state and every word. This lights what it is told and never infers:
 * `talking` is not "the meter is above a threshold", it is what the voice stack said.
 *
 * -- DESIGN PASS 02 -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * IT DRAWS ITS OWN EVERYTHING NOW. It was an `OpPanel` holding an `OpGauge`, two
 * `OpKeyCap`s and an `OpChip` -- four shared components, every one of them either
 * augmented, filled, or both. The frame, the meter, the keycaps and the counter are all
 * local, exactly as MenuView.vue carries a local frame and row, and for the same reason:
 * the four shared ones are used by surfaces nobody has looked at yet.
 *
 * THIS BLOCK PINS ITSELF, so unlike the other four it is its own positioned wrapper: it
 * carries the perspective, the paint containment and the tilt sign itself. It is anchored
 * to the RIGHT edge, so the sign is negative and the plane pivots on the right -- and it
 * stays right-anchored in its new corner, which is why the tilt and the transform origin
 * did not change with the position and only the vertical anchor did.
 *
 * THE STATE LADDER IS THE MENU'S THREE STEPS PLUS THE ALARM. The HUD takes no pointer, so
 * `--red-deep` -- the menu's hover rung -- is free, and `detected` is exactly what it is
 * for: something is arriving but the player is not through yet. `muted` is the one state
 * that is a FAILURE to transmit, so it takes the white-hot alarm and not a red, which is
 * the same rule the gauges follow and the reason the mic has a slash as well.

   of unlit slats painted in the first of them. The owner's words were that you

   dead ones were nearly the same colour.

   THE BLOOM IS NOT THE ANSWER, whatever the old comment here claimed. `.op-lift`
   is a `drop-shadow` filter and `design-system/shapes.css` says outright that
   nothing repainting every frame may take one. A voice meter repaints while
   somebody is speaking, which is precisely when this state is on.

   So the answer is CONTRAST, which costs nothing: the unlit column drops away
   while talking, so the lit slats stand alone instead of being a slightly
   brighter red among red. Same hue, same shapes, no filter, no second colour --
   the rung the contract already gives for "this one, not those". */

   off-spec here. The weighted base the shared one is built around does not
   survive: a bottom rule 2px thick IS a fill, however thin. What is left is the
