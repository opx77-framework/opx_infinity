/**
 * The five gauge glyphs, carried over verbatim from `ICONS` in `opx77_hud/web/hud.js`.
 *
 * Inline path data and not an icon font: there is no network inside a CEF surface, so a
 * font would resolve to nothing and every gauge would show a blank box. They are paths
 * rather than markup strings because the original assigned them with `innerHTML`, and
 * `v-html` on a payload-selected key is the same hole with a Vue accent.
 *
 * `currentColor` is what carries OpGauge's tone rules down to the stroke, so nothing here
 * names a colour.
