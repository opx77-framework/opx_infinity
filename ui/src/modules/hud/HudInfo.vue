/**
 * THE READ-OUT -- money, job, street cred, and anything else Lua decides to name.
 *
 * `buildMoney` and `buildIdentity` in `opx77_hud/client/state.lua` decide which lines
 * exist, in which order, and with which tone; this draws them. It has no idea what a
 * currency is.
 *
 * -- DESIGN PASS 02 -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * THIS IS THE ONE CLUSTER ON THE HUD THAT IS A FRAME, so it is the one that draws one.
 * It was an `OpPanel`: an augmented element with `--op77-panel` at 0.94 alpha behind it
 * and the `op-rail` house marker down its leading edge. All three are gone. The frame is
 * now two opposite chamfers cut with `clip-path` and a 1px red outline drawn as an INSET
 * shadow, which is the one place a clip and a stroke can live together -- an inset shadow
 * is painted over the padding box, so the clip trims it to the chamfer instead of
 * shearing an outset one off the element.
 *
 * THE BACKING IS GONE AND THE SHADOW IS BACK. The pass-01 note in this file said the
 * panel is what made the read-out legible "so the shadow is gone with it". There is no
 * panel now, so the double `text-shadow` returns -- once, on `.hud` in HudRoot.vue, where
 * it is inherited by this file and the other four.
 *
 * `--op77-hud-veil` is the escape hatch, the same dial the menu carries under its own
 * name: 0 by default, raised to about 0.5 if a column of numbers washes out over a
 * daylight plaza. One number to reverse the decision instead of a rewrite.
