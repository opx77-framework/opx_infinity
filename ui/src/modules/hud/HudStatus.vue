/**
 * THE STATUS STRIP -- bleeding, burning, netrunning, whatever else the status source
 * publishes. This surface draws them and owns none of them.
 *
 * THE STRIP IS UNTRUSTED INPUT. The client's local bus is shared with every resource on
 * the host, so the original bounded everything in Lua before it reached the page: at most
 * MAX_CHIPS, no id means dropped, the overflow count clamped. The page repeated those
 * bounds rather than trusting its sender, and so does this.
 *
 * The countdown is the page's own arithmetic. `remainingMs` arrives as a DURATION and is
 * turned into a deadline here, on arrival, exactly as hud.js did: the two clocks then
 * never have to agree, and a frame that took 40ms to arrive does not make the chip run
 * 40ms long. `remainingMs` is also deliberately not part of Lua's frame signature -- a
 * counter ticking down is not a new image, and the page animates it alone.
 *
 * -- DESIGN PASS 02 -----------------------------------------------------------
 *
 * THE CHIP IS DRAWN HERE NOW. It was `OpChip`, which is `.op-tag` plus
 * `data-augmented-ui="tr-clip"` plus a `--op77-panel` fill -- all three banned on this
 * surface -- and it is shared with the admin staff tags, so it could not simply be
 * changed. A chip is now a chamfered 1px frame with nothing behind it.
 *
 * THE COUNTDOWN MOVES BY `transform`. It was a `width` in percent rewritten every 50ms,
 * which is a layout and a paint twenty times a second per timed chip; `scaleX` on the
 * same bar is a composited transform and costs neither. The 20 Hz timer itself is
 * unchanged, including the 0.002 dead band that stops it writing when nothing moved.
