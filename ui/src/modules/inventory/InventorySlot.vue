/**
 * One cell of a grid.
 *
 * It renders what it is given and emits what the player did. It never changes its
 * own count, and it never decides that a drop was legal.
 *
 * ── DESIGN PASS 02 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * NO FILL, ANYWHERE -- AND THEN ONE, ON PURPOSE. Read this paragraph and the
 * next one together; neither is true on its own. The cell used to be
 * `background: var(--op77-panel)` with a `--op77-line` border and an accent wash
 * on the drop target -- three fills in one 78px box. All three are gone, and
 * none of the three came back: a cell's STATE is still an OUTLINE and nothing
 * else, expressed in that outline's WEIGHT, its COLOUR and whether it BLOOMS.
 *
 * THE GROUND IS BACK UNDER THE OUTLINE, AND ONLY UNDER IT. The owner asked for
 * it in as many words -- "give the slots a background, and the drop one too" --
 * and it is his call to make. It is also the one place the no-fill rule was
 * actually costing something: a 50px item picture and a white stack count
 * sitting directly on a blown-out daylight plaza are unreadable however good the
 * frame around them is, and no amount of stroke fixes a picture. So a cell gets
 * a GROUND -- a dark, low-alpha plate whose entire job is to buy the ART and the
 * COUNT a backdrop.
 *
 * AND THE GROUND IS RED, which is his second instruction on it -- "for the
 * inventory backgrounds, make them red please" -- and the correct one: a cold
 * blue-black plate was the one thing on this surface belonging to no palette at
 * all, a borrowed `--op77-panel-quiet` sitting inside a red frame, and it read as
 * a hole cut in the design rather than as part of it. So the ground is the
 * surface's OWN red, taken down until it is a black: #1c0809 is `--red-idle`'s
 * rgb at 12%, #4a1519 the same rgb at 32%. Nothing else about it moved.
 *
 * RED, NOT A RED PLATE, and the difference is the whole job. The ground exists
 * so a 50px picture and a white stack count survive a blown-out street; a
 * saturated red behind them would swallow both and be worse than the no-fill
 * state this started from, because it would be a fill that pays for nothing. The
 * test every value below has to pass is that it reads as a SHADOW with a red
 * cast at a glance and only declares its hue when you look for it. That is why
 * these are 12% and 32% of a red rather than a red, and why raising them is not
 * a free hand: past roughly 40% the icons start to go.
 *
 * THIS IS NOT A LICENCE TO FILL ANYTHING ELSE. Two elements were named and two
 * elements changed: the cell here, and `.ground` in `InventoryView.vue`. The
 * panels, the tabs, the rows, the readouts, the load rules and the detail plate
 * stay unfilled, and the surface is still outlines over live gameplay. If you
 * are here to "fix" a fill back out of the pass, these two are deliberate --
 * anything else you find is not.
 *
 * TWO CHANNELS, NOT ONE LONGER LADDER. The ground does not restate the frame and
 * must not be read as another rung of it. The FRAME says what is HAPPENING to a
 * slot -- at rest, under the pointer, receiving, vacated. The GROUND says what
 * the slot IS, which is only ever one of two things. Five frames, two grounds:
 *
 *   plate    #1c0809 @ 0.78   a slot                 -- empty or occupied
 *   slab     #4a1519 @ 0.90   something is ABOUT TO BE -- the drop target
 *
 * AN EMPTY CELL USED TO BE A THIRD, HOLLOW GROUND at 0.28 with a 1px stroke at
 * 0.30, so that "an empty cell and a full one no longer read alike". The owner
 * asked for the opposite, in a sentence that covered the whole screen: the
 * buttons, the slots and the drop zone all in the menu's one style. He is right
 * about what it costs, too -- an empty slot is not a fainter kind of slot, it is
 * a slot with nothing in it, and the thing that says so is that nothing is drawn
 * in it. Spending a whole channel to restate that left a grid of forty cells
 * where the container's own edges were the palest thing on screen.
 *
 * A hovered cell still does not gain a ground: the frame has already said it and
 * a second statement would only dilute the first.
 *
 * THE TARGET USED TO BE THE ONLY WARM GROUND ON THE GRID, and that was doing the
 * work of saying "it lands here" while the other two were blue-black. Now that
 * every ground is red, warmth is a constant and cannot separate anything, so the
 * target was re-pitched onto the two channels that survive a shared hue:
 *
 *   DENSITY   0.90 against 0.78 and 0.28 -- it is the one CLOSED cell on a grid
 *             of windows, and the only one the street does not come through
 *   DEPTH     #4a1519 against #1c0809 -- the same red carried up two and a half
 *             stops toward the LIT frame standing on it, so the ground and the
 *             2.4px `--red` outline are finally saying one thing rather than a
 *             dark thing under a bright one
 *
 * which together make the receiving cell the lightest, reddest and solidest
 * thing on a surface of thin outlines, before its bloom is counted. `.ground` in
 * `InventoryView.vue` takes the SAME slab when a drag is over the drop zone, so
 * a stack about to land reads one way wherever it is about to land.
 *
 * THE GROUND FOLLOWS THE CUT, and a plain `background` is all it takes now:
 * augmented-ui clips the element, so the background IS the chamfered shape. This
 * used to be impossible -- a rectangle under a chamfered frame left a 6px
 * triangle of plate past the diagonal -- which is why the ground was painted into
 * the sprite as the path's own `fill`. The state idiom survives it: one custom
 * property moves a cell a whole step on both channels at once.
 *
 * HOW FIVE STATES READ APART IN THE OUTLINE ALONE. This ladder was carrying all
 * five of them before there was a ground beneath it and it still is: the ground
 * added a channel beside it and took nothing from it. Weight is the ordering and
 * colour is the voice; they move together, so either alone is enough to rank a
 * cell:
 *
 *   empty      1.4px   --red-idle    -- the slot exists, and that is all it says
 *   occupied   1.4px   --red-idle    -- something is in it, and the item says so
 *   hover      1.8px   --red-deep    -- denser, NOT brighter, and no bloom
 *   target     2.4px   --red         -- lit and the ONLY cell that blooms
 *
 * THE DRAGGED CELL IS NOT ON THAT RAMP, and that is the whole solve. A fifth
 * step of weight between hover and target would be indistinguishable from both
 * at 78px. So the cell the stack is being dragged OUT of does not get a heavier
 * frame -- it gets a BROKEN one: four corner brackets in `--red-hi` and no edges
 * at all. It is the only discontinuous outline on the surface, so it cannot be
 * confused with any closed frame however heavy, and the shape states exactly
 * what is true -- this slot has been vacated and is waiting to be closed again.
 * Its content drops to 0.3 opacity so the brackets are what is left.
 *
 * FOUR OF THE FIVE STATES ARE AUGMENTED, and the fifth cannot be. A colour and a
 * weight are `--aug-border-bg` and `--aug-border-all`; the DRAG state is four
 * corner brackets with no edges, which is a different shape class and not a
 * different colour, and augmented-ui's border layer is a continuous ring around
 * the clip path. So the cell's augmentation is bound rather than static: while
 * it is being dragged the element is un-augmented, unclipped, and the one
 * surviving sprite in the runtime paints its brackets whole.
 *
 * THE CUT IS 6px, which is what the old 20x20 sprite's tiles worked out to at
 * cell size. It asks for the border layer alone, so a forty-slot grid costs one
 * pseudo-element per cell rather than two.
 *
 * THE COLOURS AND THE SHADOWS ARE NOT DECLARED HERE. They are inherited, from
 * `.room` in `InventoryView.vue`, and that is the mechanism HudRoot.vue settled:
 * a scoped stylesheet cannot reach into a child component, but a CUSTOM PROPERTY
 * set on an ancestor inherits down the whole tree regardless of scoping. So the
 * ink, the separation shadow, the bloom, the resting lettering red and the
 * unfilled part of a rule are declared once on the surface and read from here --
 * one place to change the voice, and no `:deep()` anywhere.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL LOCAL, and why the split falls where it does: the five FRAMES
 * below, because they are geometry before they are colour and the 6px tile above
 * is sized for this grid and nothing else. HudVitals.vue draws the same line --
 * it takes the palette from the root and keeps its own track.
 *
 * EVERY INHERITED VALUE CARRIES A LITERAL FALLBACK. A cell rendered outside the
 * surface -- in isolation, in a test, or by a view that has not declared the
 * palette -- still draws itself rather than drawing nothing.

/* =============================================================================
   THE ONE SPRITE LEFT IN THE RUNTIME -- the DRAG state, four corner brackets and
   no edges.

   It survives because it is a SHAPE and not a colour: augmented-ui draws a
   continuous ring around the clip path and cannot open four gaps in it. Every
   stroke lives inside a corner tile, because anything drawn outside one lands in
   a stretched edge slice and tiles down the whole side. The top-right bracket IS
   the chamfer, which keeps the broken frame the same shape as the closed one.

   Its ground is the HOLLOW one, and that is not a compromise: a vacated slot is
   about to be empty, so it stands on what an empty slot stands on. It is a
   SEPARATE unstroked path ahead of the bracket group -- the brackets are four
   open strokes and a fill on those would close four shapes meant to stay open.
