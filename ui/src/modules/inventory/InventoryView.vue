/**
 * THE INVENTORY -- the bag on the left, whatever is open beside it on the right.
 *
 * THE PAGE SENDS INTENTS. It reports that the player dragged slot 3 of container
 * 41 onto slot 9 of container 58. Whether that is a move, a stack, a swap or a
 * refusal is decided in Lua, along with what the bag then weighs. Nothing here
 * writes a count, a weight or a slot; every number drawn is one Lua last pushed.
 *
 * The handle: Lua opens with a spec carrying a handle, every emit echoes it, and
 * a payload carrying a different one belongs to a screen that has been replaced
 * and is dropped. A staff search opening over an inventory that is already up is
 * exactly that case.
 *
 * ── DESIGN PASS 02 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THIS SURFACE DRAWS ITS OWN FRAMES AND ITS OWN ROWS, exactly as MenuView.vue
 * does and for the same reason. It used `OpPanel`, `OpRow`, `OpTabs`, `OpGauge`,
 * `OpKeyCap` and `OpScrim`; all six are gone from here and none of them was
 * touched, because all six are shared with prompts, target, panel and the entry
 * form. Three things made them unusable on this pass rather than merely
 * off-style:
 *
 *   1. THEY FILL. `OpPanel` paints `--op77-panel`, `OpRow`'s selected state
 *      paints `--op77-accent`, `OpTabs`' active tab paints it too, `OpGauge` is
 *      twenty filled blocks and `OpScrim` is a full-screen wash. Rule 1 of the
 *      pass is that nothing is filled.
 *   2. THEY ARE YELLOW. Every one of them reads `--op77-accent`, which
 *      `.op-theme-city` on <html> makes Night City yellow. There is no yellow on
 *      this surface.
 *   3. THEY ARE augmented-ui. `--aug-border-bg` is one colour on four sides with
 *      no per-side form, it confiscates the element's two pseudo-elements -- and
 *      this surface needs one of them for the interlace -- and it re-clips on
 *      resize, which for a grid that reflows its column count is a clip storm.
 *
 * WHAT IS NOT A CONTROL DOES NOT GET A FRAME. The detail plate's readouts, the
 * load rule and the separators are lines of type and 1px rules. A closed
 * chamfered frame on this surface means "you can press this", and there are
 * exactly four kinds of thing that can be pressed: a tab, a footer button, a
 * cell, and a row of the per-slot menu.
 *
 * NOTHING ABOUT THE PROTOCOL CHANGED. Same channels, same handle guard, same
 * intents, same payload fields. Only what the player sees.
 *
 * ── CENTRED PASS ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * THE LAYOUT IS `opx77_inventory`'s, THE STYLE IS OURS. The owner asked for the
 * old resource's positioning back, and what that actually means, read off
 * `opx77_inventory/web/inventory.css`:
 *
 *   * ONE CENTRED PAIR. `.screen` is `inset: 0` with `align-items: center` and
 *     `justify-content: center`; `.frame` is two panels, `align-items:
 *     flex-start`, `gap: --op-space-7`. Both axes, dead centre.
 *   * PANELS ARE A FIXED WIDTH DERIVED FROM THE GRID, not `flex: 1`. Five columns
 *     of a 90px square, seven rows before it scrolls -- see `geometry.ts`.
 *   * THE PAIR SCALES, IT DOES NOT REFLOW. `fit()` is reproduced verbatim,
 *     numbers included.
 *   * THE RIGHT-HAND PLACE IS NEVER EMPTY. With a container open beside the bag
 *     it is that container; with none it is the ground plate, `align-self:
 *     stretch`ed to the bag's height. THIS IS WHY THE OLD ONE READ BETTER: the
 *     bag does not move when a stash opens or closes, because the pair's width
 *     never changes. An `flex: 1 1 0` column that disappears takes the centre
 *     with it.
 *   * THE DETAIL IS A PLATE AT THE POINTER, not a third column. That is what
 *     makes the pair a PAIR: two equal panels about the centre line instead of
 *     three unequal ones with the widest in the middle.
 *
 * WHAT WAS LEFT BEHIND, all of it style rather than geometry: the Night City
 * yellow accent override, the `--op77-panel` fills, the `.plate::before`
 * clip-path plates, the `--op77-line*` hairlines, the SVG ring gauge, the
 * ok/warn/danger wear ramp, the accent-filled hotbar keycap, the glyph-only
 * 32x30 tabs, the `.screen` scrim, the pickup feed (a toast in this runtime) and
 * the drag ghost.
 *
 * THERE IS NO ENCLOSURE ANY MORE. The `clip-path` chamfer, the inset 1px outline
 * and its arete are gone from the panels, and `.bay`/`.bay-inner` collapsed into
 * one element with them -- both existed only to carry those and the interlace.
 * A cell keeps its frame: a cell is a control.

   Reproduced verbatim, including the numbers. It is the reason the old layout

   resolution, so the bag a player learns the shape of never changes shape. A
   reflowing grid re-columns itself on every window size and on the secondary

   in the middle. Its `place()` offsets by 14px, flips to the other side of the
   pointer rather than off-screen, and never goes within 8px of an edge.

   ONE BOX AND NOT TWO. The plate and the per-slot menu used to open together as
   two boxes either side of the pointer, and one right-click read as two things
   happening. They are ONE CARD now -- what the thing is on top, what can be done

/* =============================================================================
   DESIGN PASS 02, CENTRED, NO ENCLOSURE.

   The type, the three reds plus the hot rung, the black shadows and the 9-slice
   cell frames are all unchanged. What changed is where things sit and what is
   drawn around them:

     * THE LAYOUT IS `opx77_inventory`'s. See the block at the top of the script
       for what was taken and what was left behind.
     * THE CONTAINER FRAME IS GONE. No `clip-path`, no inset outline, no arete. A
       panel is a column of instruments sitting loose on the gameplay plane, which
       is the call the owner has now made on two HUD blocks and the ALT target,
       and which the old resources also made by drawing no enclosure at all.
     * THE INTERLACE IS GONE WITH IT, and is NOT replaced. Its whole justification
       (rule 9) was that it stops an unfilled FRAME reading as a page floating in
       the air -- it was texture for a surface. With no frame there is no surface
       for it to be on, and a 1px-per-3px gradient over a bounded region draws its
       own boundary: it would paint back the exact rectangle the enclosure was
       just removed to get rid of, which is the argument the HUD agent made for
       the unenclosed clusters. Nothing was put in its place because nothing is
       missing: forty chamfered 1px cell outlines are denser technical texture
       than the gradient ever was, and the grid is where the eye actually is.
     * THE TILT IS NOW A V, NOT TWO RECEDING EDGES. Reasoned at `.frame` below.
     * TWO ELEMENTS ARE FILLED AGAIN, AND EXACTLY TWO. The owner asked for a
       background on the inventory slots "and the drop one too", and then for
       that background to be red -- the cells, in `InventorySlot.vue`, and
       `.ground` here. Both get a dark low-alpha plate under the outline so an
       item picture and a stack count survive a bright street, and both take that
       plate from this surface's own red rather than from a panel token: #1c0809
       and #4a1519 are `--red-idle`'s rgb at 12% and 32%, which is red as a BLACK
       and not a red panel -- a saturated one would swallow the icons the fill
       was added to rescue. Nothing else on the surface was touched. The full
       argument is at the top of `InventorySlot.vue`; the sizing argument for
       this file's one plate is at `.ground` below. The no-fill rule stands
       everywhere else and this is not the precedent for relaxing it.

   TWO THINGS THE PASS LEFT UNFINISHED, and both are settled here:

     * THE SURFACE NOW HAS ONE PALETTE, AT ONE ADDRESS. The ink, the separation
       shadow, the bloom, the resting lettering red and the unfilled part of a
       rule were literals repeated eighteen times across this file and
       `InventorySlot.vue` -- which is eighteen chances for the grid and the
       panel around it to drift apart, and the drift the token file was written
       to stop, reintroduced one surface lower down. They are five custom
       properties on `.room` now. A custom property INHERITS across a component
       boundary where a scoped selector does not, so the cell reads the surface's
       voice without a single `:deep()`; this is HudRoot.vue's mechanism and it
       is used here for HudRoot.vue's reason.
     * THE LOAD RULE IS SEGMENTED. It was the last readout on the surface still
       drawn as a continuous fill, which the token file argues against and the
       HUD's vitals column had already acted on: over gameplay a smooth bar has
       no edge to read against a moving backdrop, and a count of lit divisions is
       read without being looked at. It is a MASK rather than an overlay, so the
       notches are the street showing through and not a colour painted on -- see
       `.rule`, where the mechanism and its fallback are set out.
   ========================================================================== */

/* --- THE RED --------------------------------------------------------------
   Local to this surface, as the menu's is: `.op-theme-city` on <html> makes
   `--op77-accent` Night City yellow for every surface, and there is no yellow
   here. Three steps dim -> deep -> lit, plus the lit arete, plus the HOT rung.

   `--red-hot` is the alarm, and it is red: an alarm stays in the hue and climbs
   in intensity rather than leaving for white. `--op-text` is now ONLY

  /* THE SHADOWS, NAMED FOR THE REASON HudRoot.vue NAMES ITS ONE: more elements,

     A custom property set here INHERITS through the whole subtree regardless of
     scoping, which is the only way a rule written in this file can reach a cell
     drawn by `InventorySlot.vue` -- a scoped selector stops at the component
     boundary and a custom property does not. That is how the grid takes the
     surface's voice without a single `:deep()`.

       --ink        the two-pass ink every glyph on this surface sits in. There
                    is no backing and no enclosure, so a letter is on the street:
                    the tight dark pass gives it an edge, the wide soft pass
                    lifts it off a blown-out plaza. It INHERITS, so a panel
                    declares it once and the heading, the readouts and the rows
                    all take it.
       --ink-tight  the first pass on its own, for the marks that carry no text
                    and therefore take no text-shadow -- the three 2px rules.
       --dark       the separation shadow under a closed frame. Rectangular where
                    the frame is chamfered, which at this blur reads as the
                    corner darkening rather than as a second shape.
       --bloom      what a LIT control does instead of filling. It REPLACES
                    `--dark`; the two are never stacked, because a thing that is

/* THE TILT, RE-REASONED FOR A CENTRED LAYOUT.

   It was `+7deg` on a left-anchored bay and `-7deg` on a right-anchored one, each
   about the screen edge it was pinned to. Centred, that reasoning does not
   survive: the pair is anchored to no edge, and rule 5 of the contract derives
   both the sign and the origin from the edge a surface IS anchored to, so it
   supplies no value for something in the middle. Rotating a centred plane about
   its own centre is worse than nothing -- half of it comes toward the player and
   half goes away, which is paper twisting on a spindle, not a surface receding.

   But each PANEL still has an outer edge, so each panel keeps the rule about its
   own: the left one turns about its left edge, the right one about its right. Both
   inner edges therefore recede toward the middle and the pair reads as a shallow
   V opening toward the player -- which is what a visor actually is, two facets
   angled in around the wearer's centre line.

   The perspective lives HERE and not on a panel, and that is the whole reason the
   V reads: one vanishing point, at the centre of the pair, shared. A perspective
   per panel would give each its own and the two would simply lean.

   `scale()` from the fit rides on the same element. The panels' `rotateY` is
   flattened into it, which is correct -- one axis, no 3D box in the room. */

   it gets the tight ink pass as a box-shadow instead.

   IT IS SEGMENTED, WHICH IS THE ONE THING IT WAS MISSING. The token file makes
   the argument and the HUD's vitals column already acts on it: over gameplay a
   continuous fill has no edge to read against a moving backdrop, and a count of
   lit divisions can be read at a glance without being looked at. A bag that is
   seven tenths full now says seven rather than "most of the way along".

   THE DIVISIONS ARE A MASK AND NOT AN OVERLAY, and that is the whole reason this
   is allowed on a surface with no fills. An overlay would have to PAINT the
   notches in something, and the only honest something over live gameplay is
   black -- which is a fill, forty of them across the surface, and it would read
   as a dark bar with light ticks rather than as a bar with pieces missing. A
   mask removes paint instead of adding it, so the street shows through each
   notch; and because a mask applies to the element AND its children, one
   declaration cuts the track and the fill on the same grid, which is what makes
   the lit part end on a division instead of halfway across one.

   Both spellings, because the Chromium behind a CEF surface is not the one on
   this desk. A mask that does not resolve leaves an ungraduated bar, which is
   exactly what was here before and is the right thing to fall back to. */

   THE GROUND -- the right-hand place when nothing is open beside the bag. A
   control, so it keeps a closed frame; stretched to the bag's height, as the old
   resource's `.panel-right { align-self: stretch }` did, so the pair stays square.

   AND THE ONE FILLED SURFACE ON THIS FILE, on the owner's instruction: "give the
   slots a background, and the drop one too". "The drop one" is this. It is the
   other half of what `InventorySlot.vue`'s header sets out, and the reasoning
   there is the reasoning here -- so the two do not have to be kept in agreement
   by anyone's memory, this plate takes the SAME two grounds a cell takes, at the
   same alphas:

     plate  #1c0809 @ 0.55   armed, waiting -- a bay, and a bay has a floor
     slab   #4a1519 @ 0.90   the drag is OVER it -- the identical lit slab the
                             target cell stands on, so "it lands here" is one
                             mark on this surface and not two

   BOTH ARE RED, on the owner's second word on this -- "for the inventory
   backgrounds, make them red please". #1c0809 is `--red-idle`'s rgb at 12% and
   #4a1519 is the same rgb at 32%: the surface's own red taken down until it is a
   black, which is the only way a fill can be red here and still do the job a
   fill was asked for. The alphas did not move with the hue.

   0.55 and not the cell's 0.78 because this plate is twenty times the area of a
   cell and carries two lines of display type rather than a picture: it needs to
   separate a word from the street, not hold a 50px image against a white plaza,
   and at this size 0.78 stops being a ground and becomes the panel the pass
   removed. The same argument is why the hue had to go DOWN and not up when it
   went red: at this area a red anyone can name is a red panel, and there is only
   one of those on the whole surface to notice it. The resting state multiplies
   it by the 0.45 below in any case, so with nothing in flight the floor is a
   quarter-opacity shade and the surface is still open.

   NOTHING ELSE IN THIS FILE IS FILLED and nothing else should be. The frames
   below are LOCAL COPIES of `--frame-idle` / `--frame-on` rather than an edit to
   them, precisely so this stays true: those two are shared with the tabs, the
   footer buttons and the per-slot menu rows, and putting a `fill` in them would
   have filled nine controls the owner did not ask about.
