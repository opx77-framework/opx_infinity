/**
 * The operator's theme, written onto the document root as custom properties.
 *
 * WHY PROPERTIES AND NOT A STYLESHEET. `tokens.css` is already the one place a
 * value is decided, and every rung, ground, chamfer and tilt in the runtime reads
 * it through `var()`. Overriding those on `:root` is therefore the whole of the
 * mechanism: one write per value, the cascade does the rest, and nothing is
 * rebuilt, re-parsed or re-fetched. A second stylesheet, a `<style>` element or a
 * class per theme would each have needed the same list of values and a way to
 * keep it in step with this one.
 *
 * NOTHING THAT ARRIVES HERE IS CSS. The wire carries numbers only -- a colour is
 * three integers, a chamfer is a count of pixels -- and this file is what turns
 * them into `rgb(...)`, `px` and `deg`. That is not defensive dressing over a
 * string API: there is no string API. An operator's accent is parsed out of
 * `#RRGGBB` in Lua and travels as its channels, so no text an operator typed ever
 * reaches a stylesheet, and a payload cannot carry a declaration, a `}` or a
 * second property however it was produced.
 *
 * THE BOUNDS BELOW EXIST TWICE, here and in `modules/theme/shared/palette.lua`.
 * That is deliberate and it is the house rule rather than an oversight: the page
 * trusts nothing it is told, including by its own server, and `bridge/types.ts`
 * says so for every other payload on this surface. The Lua copy is what tells an
 * operator their value was out of range; this copy is what makes it impossible
 * for an out-of-range value to be applied.
 *
 * AN ABSENT KEY MEANS THE STYLESHEET WINS. Applying a theme clears every property
 * this file knows about first and then writes what it was given, so a server that
 * configures only a tilt gets the shipped ladder with a different tilt, and a
 * server that configures nothing at all gets exactly what `tokens.css` says. That
 * is the property that keeps an unconfigured server byte-identical to the one
 * that shipped, and it is why there are no defaults in this file.
