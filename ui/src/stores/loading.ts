/**
 * The game's own loading screen, as `modules/loading` last described it.
 *
 * BOUND AT THE SURFACE, NOT IN A VIEW. `hide` decides whether the HUD-like views are on
 * screen at all, and if it were held by the cover component a throw in the cover would
 * strand it: ModuleHost unmounts the cover, the subscription goes with it, and a `hide`
 * that arrived true stays true for the session -- no gauges, no key strip, no toasts,
 * and nothing anywhere saying why. So `createSurface` subscribes this the way it does the
 * theme and the catalogue, and the cover only READS it.
 *
 * Nothing here is decided on the page. When the cover goes up, whether there is a film
 * and what fraction to draw are all Lua's answer; the one rule the page adds is in the
 * cover itself -- it never draws "done".
