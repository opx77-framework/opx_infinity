/**
 * How much of a screen corner a transient surface is holding right now, in pixels
 * measured up from that corner's inset.
 *
 * THE OWNER: "pour le hud micro si prompt montrer alors fait en sorte que l'hud se
 * retrouve pas sous les prompt". Both default to the bottom-right corner, and the key
 * strip is drawn over the voice block whenever a prompt is up. The strip is the thing
 * being read at that moment, so it keeps its place and the voice block steps up by what
 * the strip holds; when the strip closes the hold is zero and the block comes back.
 *
 * Same shape as `ui.ts`: a module-scope `reactive`, no Pinia, and nothing here is
 * authoritative -- it is a measurement one module publishes and another reads.
