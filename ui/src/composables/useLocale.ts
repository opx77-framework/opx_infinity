 * errors, module payloads, rpc rejections -- because Lua owns the player's language
 * and `locales/en.lua` is where the sentence lives. A page that hardcodes "Loading..."
 * is a page that is English-only in a platform that is not.
 *
 * A missing key renders as the key. Loudly wrong is the point: an untranslated
 * `demo.row.balance` on screen gets fixed, an invented "Balance" never does.
