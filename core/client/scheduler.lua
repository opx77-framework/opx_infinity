-- Twenty-one resources used to get twenty-one budgets. One runtime gets one, and
-- the platform's is unforgiving: exceeding the per-resume instruction budget
-- raises `Open77 script execution budget exceeded`, which unwinds straight out of
-- the coroutine body. A `while true do ... Wait(n) end` loop that hits it is never
-- resumed again -- it does not crash the resource, it does not repeat, and it logs
-- nothing. A loop that quietly stopped is almost always this.
--
-- So there is one loop, and it is defensive:
--   * at most MAX_PER_TICK jobs run in a single resume, rotating so none starves
--   * a job is wrapped in pcall, and one that raises repeatedly is suspended
--   * registration staggers first runs, so N jobs on the same interval do not all
--     land on the same tick for the rest of the session

-- cap binds on 893 passes out of 899.
--
-- AND IT STAYS AT FOUR ANYWAY. Raising it to ten was the wrong half of the
-- problem,
-- and it was raised on a simulation of THROUGHPUT while the thing the cap
-- protects is the per-resume instruction BUDGET -- which nothing off-platform
-- can measure, and whose failure mode is written at the top of this file: the
-- loop is retired for the session, silently, taking the health bar, the
-- prompts, every marker, the menu keys and the eye with it, with no line in any
-- log. Ten of these jobs in one resume is `admin.tags` walking 32 bodies,
-- `prompts.pass` sorting 32 groups, four independent distance sweeps and
-- `admin.doors` deriving up to 256 doors, all on one budget.
--
-- The throughput complaint was real. The fix for it is eleven lines below, in
-- how `nextAt` is rebased, and it costs nothing.
