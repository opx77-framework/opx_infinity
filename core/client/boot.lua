-- `Scheduler.Stop()` against a loop that the boot thread then STARTED again on
-- its next resume -- a loop with no resource left under it, which is the shape
-- `Scheduler.Stop`'s own docstring says it exists to prevent ("the VM can
-- outlive the resource"). The generation barrier retires the old loop; nothing
