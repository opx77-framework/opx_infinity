--- The surface, the bridge to it, and the focus stack.
-- @author dop42
--
-- Twelve resources used to own a full-screen CEF surface each, ranked by a
-- hand-maintained z-index ladder from 700 to 760. One resource may have eight,
-- so a surface per feature is not an option any more -- and it was never a good
-- one: twelve browsers meant twelve copies of the same stylesheet, because each
-- WebUI runs on its own isolated origin and cannot load a file from another.
--
-- ONE surface, two layers inside the page. It was two surfaces -- an overlay and
-- an interactive layer -- and that split cost 400 kB of byte-identical duplication
-- (the Vue runtime, the design system, eight woff2 faces) for two properties: a
-- frame rate per layer, and an exception in a heavy view being unable to blank the
-- HUD. Both are given up knowingly. `fps` is fixed at creation for the whole page,
-- and the layers are now separated by a component boundary in one JS realm rather
-- than by two browsers.
--
-- `Overlay()` and `Interactive()` both answer with that one surface. Callers still
-- pass a target, because which LAYER a module draws on is still real on the page
-- side -- the overlay layer never takes a pointer.
--
-- Channel names are `opx:<module>:<verb>`. The surface id is `opx` and
-- `OPX.Surface` prefixes it, so a caller passes `character:loaded` and the page
-- sees `opx:character:loaded`.

OPX.UI = OPX.UI or {}

local ID = 'opx'
local REPLY = 'reply'

-- One surface, built on first use and kept until Teardown.
local page = nil

local focusStack = {}

-- Forward-declared: the surface's own `focus:set` reconciliation is wired inside
-- `create()`, which is written above the definition below. Without this the
-- closure there would resolve a GLOBAL of this name -- nil at call time -- and
-- the reconciliation would raise the first time the page announced a change.
local applyFocus

--- Wires every channel a view may emit before its own module is running.
--
-- THE PAGE IS BUILT BEFORE THE MODULES ARE. `core/client/boot.lua` creates the
-- surface first -- deliberately, so a module drawing from `Start` has something
-- to draw on -- and then walks the modules a FRAME AT A TIME, because `Start`
-- yields between them to reset the instruction budget. That is a window of
-- twenty-odd frames.
--
-- A view emits `opx:<module>:ready` from its `onMounted`, and `ui/src/bridge/
-- channel.ts` releases all of them in the same tick as `opx:ready`. With warm CEF
-- assets the page mounts inside the window -- which is every reconnection, and a
-- character switch ends the session -- so those signals arrived while the module
-- that answers them was still several frames from registering. There was no host
-- listener on the channel at all, so nothing was dropped by this resource: it was
-- never delivered to it. And the page says ready ONCE.
--
-- Wiring them here, against the module list rather than a hand-kept one, gives
-- every `<id>:ready` a listener from the moment the page exists. What arrives
-- with no handler yet is held by `lib/client/surface.lua` and replayed to the
-- module when it finally registers.
local function wireReadyChannels(surface)
	for _, module in ipairs(OPX.Modules.All()) do
		OPX.Surface.Wire(surface, module.Id .. ':ready')
	end
end

-- Locale keys written to the page in one `locale:set`.
--
-- THE WHOLE CATALOGUE IN ONE SEND WAS PAST THE HOST'S CEILING. It is 1,533 keys
-- and about 78 kB for one language today, and it grows with every module added:
-- `modules/inventory/client/main.lua` records that "a page write past 1,024 value
-- nodes is dropped without a word", which is why the item catalogue is drained 40
-- at a time, and `modules/inventory/server/containers.lua` sets its own budget at
-- 900. This one send was half as large again as that figure and was not chunked
-- at all.
--
-- What it cost when the host refused it: the answer was discarded, so nothing
-- knew; `useLocale.ts` answers the key on a miss, so EVERY label on EVERY surface
-- renders as its raw key for the whole session; it is sent once, from the `ready`
-- handler, with no retry. `modules/hud/client/main.lua` records players seeing
-- `hud.voice.state.idle` painted on screen, which is exactly this symptom.
-- The drain's grain, taken from the one drain that is proven live:
-- `modules/inventory/client/main.lua`'s `CATALOG_PART = 40`, on purpose. Its
-- comment is the law: an entry costs about sixty VM instructions to shape, and
-- a client handler that passes 10 000 is stopped by the host -- the same
-- figure `core/shared/lifecycle.lua` names (~10 000 instructions). Forty
-- shaped entries are ~2 400 instructions; the first attempt's 250 were
-- ~15 000 -- every part over the ceiling by itself, so the chunking died
-- exactly as the unchunked send had.
local CATALOGUE_PART = 40

--- Writes the locale catalogue to the page, in parts, reading every answer.
---
--- The page's boot subscribes to `locale:set` and cannot call back for a string
--- per render, so it gets the catalogue rather than a lookup. `first` clears what
--- the page holds and `done` says the last part has landed -- the same idiom
--- `modules/inventory`'s `drainCatalog` uses, and for the same reason.
---
--- ONE BOUNDED UNIT PER RESUME. A `Wait(0)` resets the per-resume instruction
--- budget (~10 000 instructions), the same argument `core/shared/lifecycle.lua`
--- makes for yielding between module `Start`s: the merge, the key list and each
--- 40-key part shaped and sent in one resume is one budget between them.
