-- THIS LINE USED TO BE THE COPY THAT DRIFTED FURTHEST. It held fourteen names
-- under a comment saying core may not read a module's namespace, so the lists
-- are kept in step by hand -- and by the time anyone counted, the page drew 45,
-- `Model.ICONS` named 47 and this named 14. The premise was true and the
-- conclusion was wrong: core may not read a MODULE, but a module can read CORE,
-- so the set belongs here, one level down, in `core/shared/glyphs.lua`.
--
-- Nothing had broken, and that is worth saying plainly rather than dressing the
-- fix up: no caller in this resource passes a toast an icon, so the thirty-one
-- names missing from this table could not refuse anything. It was a trap set for

-- every player. The cost of dropping one is a silent toast; the cost of refusing
-- the toast is a message nobody receives.

--- Raises a toast and answers its id. `id` may be supplied to replace a toast
--- already on screen rather than stacking another under it -- a player who runs
--- the same command twice should see one answer, not a pile.
---
--- `icon` is a name from `OPX.Glyphs` and is REFUSED rather than dropped when it
--- is not one, exactly as the menu refuses an item naming a glyph it does not
--- have: a caller who misspelt `vehcile` wants to hear about it now, not to
--- wonder later why one toast in ten has no picture. This holds because the set
--- IS the page's set -- a name outside it is a typo and not a stale copy, which
--- is the whole reason `OPX.Glyphs` exists.
---
--- THE RULE, NOT THE ROLL-CALL: every caller reads the pair and does something
--- with a `nil`. This paragraph used to NAME the callers -- six that checked,
--- three that discarded, "so the sentence above is true again" -- and it was
--- wrong within a day of being written: two more checking callers appeared
--- (`modules/teleports`, `modules/admin/client/announce.lua`) and the two net
--- handlers at the foot of THIS file were discarding the whole time, which is
--- every server-originated refusal and every command answer. Its own closing
--- line said claims about call sites go stale; it was describing itself.
---
--- So the invariant is stated once and enforced once, and no list is kept. What
--- a discarded `nil` costs is not the glyph refusal -- a caller who misspells
--- `vehcile` finds out in testing -- it is `surface_unavailable` and
--- `payload_refused`, which mean the player was told NOTHING and nobody knows.
--- The handlers below relay that to the server's journal rather than to a log
--- file on the player's machine, because from the server a client whose overlay
--- never came up is indistinguishable from a quiet one.
---
--- THERE IS NO DEFAULT GLYPH PER KIND. The set above names domains -- a door, a
--- lock, money -- and holds no tick and no warning mark, so a default would have
--- to draw a padlock on `error.tooFast`. The kind already reaches the player as
--- the frame, the tone and the toast's own kind tag; a glyph that guessed would
--- be the one thing on the surface saying something untrue.
-- `stinger` is what plays around the message rather than with it: `open` runs
-- first and holds the toast back until it ends, `close` runs once the toast has
-- gone. It is the one field here a CONFIG supplies, so a name that does not fit
-- the rule is dropped and logged rather than refused -- see `stingerOf`.
