OPX = OPX or {}

--- The version this resource's manifest declares.
--
-- ASKED, NOT COPIED, and the reason is that the copy was wrong. This was the
-- literal `'0.1.0'` while `open77.lua` said `0.1.2`, so every boot line, every
-- diagnostics dump and every client report named a version that had not been
-- deployed for two releases -- and the only symptom was somebody reading the
-- wrong number while chasing something else. `opx_lib` carries a test against
-- exactly this failure because it happened there first; here it happened and
-- nothing was watching.
--
-- Both runtimes can answer it and neither needs a permission: the client has
-- `Open77.resource.version()`, and the server reads its own manifest through
-- `Open77.resource.metadata(name, 'version')`. The literal below is the last
-- resort for a host that answers neither. `tests/run.lua` reads this very line
-- out of this file and holds it against the manifest, so even that path cannot
-- drift silently -- and it is read from the SOURCE rather than published on
-- `OPX`, because the suite forbids hanging internals there and is right to.

--
-- AN ORDINARY GLOBAL READ, and `rawget` being absent is the point. These were
-- `rawget(_G, 'TriggerClientEvent')`, which is wrong twice over: `rawget` skips
-- a metatable, so a host exposing a global through an `__index` accessor answers
-- nil; and `_G` is not necessarily the chunk's `_ENV`, so a host that hands a
-- resource its own environment answers nil again. Either way BOTH of these go
-- false, `runsHere` in the registry then answers false for 'server' and for
-- 'client', and every side-specific module is marked absent -- a resource that
-- boots, logs a clean module report, and does nothing.
--
-- It bought nothing. Reading a global that is not there yields nil in Lua and
-- never raises, which is the only thing `rawget` could have been guarding. This
-- is the same defect `opx_lib/client/native.lua` was fixed for, and that library
-- carries a regression test for it; the eight other sites in `core/` and `lib/`
-- were corrected with this one.
