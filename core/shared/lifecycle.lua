--- Runs one phase over the runnable modules, in order.
--
-- `Start` YIELDS BETWEEN MODULES, and that is not politeness to the frame rate.
--
-- The host bounds a task by a PER-FRAME instruction budget and stops it dead when
-- it is passed; a `Wait(0)` moves to the next frame and the budget starts again.
-- Every module's `Start` used to run in one frame, so the whole client boot spent
-- ONE budget between them: each module made the next one likelier to trip, and the
-- one that actually tripped depended on how much the frame had already spent.
--
-- That is exactly what was seen. The inventory reported, intermittently:
--
--   client module: inventory failed
--     start failed: modules/target/shared/model.lua:334: script execution budget exceeded
--
-- It is not the inventory's fault and it was never reliably the inventory: it
-- registers its world rows in `Start`, late in dependency order, so it was simply
-- often the module holding the parcel. And because `Start` raising marks a module
-- `failed`, the rest of its `Start` never ran -- which is why the symptom was "no
-- inventory AND no keybinds", with no error anywhere a player could see.
--
-- `Init` is NOT given the same treatment: it is documented never to yield, it
-- builds state rather than touching the world, and a yield there would let an
-- event reach a module whose state is half built.
--
-- NEITHER IS `Api`, AND THAT IS A DECISION RATHER THAN AN OVERSIGHT -- it read
-- as one, so it is written down. The same objection applies and applies harder:
-- `Api` is where contracts are published, so a yield in the middle of it is a
-- frame in which some modules have published and some have not, and an event
-- arriving in that frame gets nil from `OPX.Api.Get` for a contract that exists.
-- The budget argument does not weigh much against it either, because an `Api`
-- body is a handful of `Provide` calls and no world reads; `Start` is where the
-- work is, and `Start` is what yields.
-- @return string|nil the id of a fatal module that failed

		-- followed IN THE SAME PHASE by the modules that require it, which run,
		-- register their handlers, and are only marked `unavailable` afterwards.
		--
		-- The cost was not. `Init` and `Api` are documented never to yield, so
		-- each of them runs in ONE resume and shares ONE instruction budget --
		-- which is the whole argument for `Start` yielding between modules. A
		-- loop over every module's `Requires` before every step, across thirty
		-- modules, is paid out of that single budget, and this file already says
		-- what happens then: "each module made the next one likelier to trip,
