--- Runs one phase over the runnable modules, in order.
--
-- EVERY PHASE YIELDS BETWEEN MODULES, and that is not politeness to the frame
-- rate -- it is the only thing standing between this boot and a dead resource.
--
-- THE BUDGET IS A WALL-CLOCK SLICE, NOT AN INSTRUCTION COUNT. `ResourceHost`
-- arms a count hook every 10 000 VM instructions and raises at whichever comes
-- first: `instructionLimitPerResume` (1 500 000, so never for us) or
-- `Clock::now() > instance.deadline`. The deadline is this resource's share of
-- the host's `frameBudget` (6 ms), and with ~28 resources running on a client
-- that share is 214 us -- BELOW THE 300 us FLOOR THE HOST REFUSES TO GO UNDER,
-- so every resume gets 300 us however little work there is. Ten thousand hooked
-- VM instructions cost more than that. The rule the platform states for script
-- authors is therefore exact: A RESUME MAY RUN AT MOST ONE HOOK INTERVAL
-- (10 000 INSTRUCTIONS) WHATEVER THE RESOURCE COUNT, AND LOOPS SPLIT THEIR WORK
-- INTO RESUMES AND YIELD BETWEEN THEM.
--
-- `Start` has yielded between its modules since the inventory was the victim:
--
--   client module: inventory failed
--     start failed: modules/target/shared/model.lua:334: script execution budget exceeded
--
-- and it was never reliably the inventory -- it registers its world rows in
-- `Start`, late in dependency order, so it was simply often the module holding
-- the parcel. `Init` and `Api` were left in one frame each, which was defensible
-- while a boot was small and stopped being defensible at 32 modules: the boot's
-- FIRST resume ran every `Init`, every `Api` and the first `Start` together, and
-- it died there. Seen in a live client (2026-09-21), twice in two sessions:
--
--   [resource:opx_infinity] core/shared/lifecycle.lua:71: Open77 script
--   execution budget exceeded
--   stack traceback:
--     core/shared/lifecycle.lua:71: in upvalue 'settle'
--     core/shared/lifecycle.lua:252: in field 'Run'
--     core/client/boot.lua:15: in function <core/client/boot.lua:9>
--
-- `71` is `OPX.Modules.Record(id)` -- a table lookup, ~1 instruction. Nothing
-- hot was named because nothing hot was there: the raise fires at the first
-- 10 000-instruction boundary after the slice expires, so the line it names is
-- just wherever the parcel ran out. Measured in the suite's own harness, that
-- first resume was 13 000 instructions against a 10 000 interval, and every
-- module the client then needed was never started: the shell sat on "Preparing
-- character" for ever because the resource that answers it had died mid-boot,
-- and the only trace was an error line no player can act on.
--
-- SO THE RESUME BOUNDARY IS AFTER EVERY MODULE IN EVERY PHASE. What is NOT
-- changed is the contract each phase documents: A PHASE BODY MUST NOT YIELD.
-- `Init` still may not call `Wait`, `Api` still may not, and this loop never
-- interrupts one -- it yields after a body has returned, so no module is ever
-- left half built. The frames introduced between modules are the frames `Start`
-- has always had: an event arriving in one of them finds the modules whose
-- phases have run and not the ones still waiting, exactly as it already could
-- while `Start` was stepping. The cost is frames during a boot nobody is playing
-- yet; the alternative is a resource that dies at ~10 000 instructions.
--
-- `Init` WAS NOT given the same treatment: it is documented never to yield, it
-- builds state rather than touching the world, and a yield there would let an
-- event reach a module whose state is half built. That reasoning is kept below,
-- with what finally outweighed it.
--
-- `Api` WAS NOT EITHER, AND THAT DECISION IS NOW REVERSED. It is left standing
-- here because the objection to yielding was a real one and is worth keeping:
-- `Api` is where contracts are published, so a yield in the middle of it is a
-- frame in which some modules have published and some have not, and an event
-- arriving in that frame gets nil from `OPX.Api.Get` for a contract that exists.
-- The second half of the argument was that the budget could not be the problem,
-- because an `Api` body is a handful of `Provide` calls and no world reads.
--
-- THAT HALF WAS WRONG, and the thirtieth module proved it. A handful of calls
-- is nothing; a handful of calls TIMES THIRTY, out of one budget, is not, and
-- adding `modules/blips` on 2026-09-21 pushed the total over. Deployed 18:29;
-- by 18:45 the journal carried, from the owner's own client:
--
--   client module: needs failed / api failed:
--   modules/needs/client/main.lua:809: Open77 script execution budget exceeded
--
-- Line 809 is `OPX.Api.Provide('needs', 1, {...})`. `needs` did nothing wrong
-- and neither did `blips`: the budget was a shared pot and the module holding
-- the parcel went without, exactly as the inventory did in `Start` above, and
-- with the same tell -- "it was never reliably the inventory". The owner saw it
-- as "je vois plus les status", because the chip strip `needs` publishes was
-- never published.
--
-- AND THE OBJECTION IS ANSWERED BY WHAT IT WAS WEIGHED AGAINST. Not yielding
-- does not avoid a frame where a contract is missing -- it buys a run where a
-- contract is missing FOREVER, because the phase dies partway and the modules
-- after the cut never publish at all. A one-frame window during boot, in a boot
-- where `Start` already spreads itself over frames, is strictly the smaller of
-- the two. It also stops being a lottery: without this, every module added from
-- now on re-rolls which existing module dies.
--
-- `Init` yields for the same reason. The objection there -- an event reaching a
-- module whose state is half built -- is weighed against the same alternative,
-- a module whose state is never built at all.

		-- The cost was not. `Init` and `Api` did not yield then, so each of them
		-- ran in ONE resume and shared ONE instruction budget -- which is the
		-- whole argument for yielding between modules, and why every phase does
		-- it now. A loop over every module's `Requires` before every step, across
