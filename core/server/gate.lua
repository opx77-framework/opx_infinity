--- The readiness gate: participation, hold, release, and the give-up watch.

--
-- Core declares its participation once, at load, which puts a hold on every
-- player who connects afterwards: it never races to take one before something
-- else moves the player, it already holds one before the player exists.
--
-- Two deadlines, and ours is the shorter. `livenessIntervalMs` is a watchdog on
-- the HOLDER, not a limit on the player -- someone may sit in a creator for an
-- hour as long as the holder refreshes. It fires only on proof that the holder
-- vanished, and the host then opens the gate itself with the detail
-- `liveness_lost:<resource>` or `timeout:<resource>` (the two sources disagree;
-- both are matched, see the handler at the foot of this file) -- possibly with
-- the player still choosing and no puppet at all. So the watch deadline sits
-- BELOW the declared interval: the runtime gives up first, and says why.
--
-- Ours is not the only hold. Every player carries a second one named
-- `__platform`, with no deadline, that no Lua can take or release: it clears only
-- once a client has announced `open77:session:gameplayReady`, with the puppet
-- really attached and alive. That is what an open gate means -- "this player is
-- incarnated", not merely "the other resources have finished". Without a
-- resource emitting it, every gate stays shut forever, hence the warning at
-- startup.
--
-- Core holds and releases; it does not decide who may come in. Loading a
-- character and reading a roster belong to whichever module provides the
-- `character` contract, so the entry sequence lives there: it holds, isolates,
-- sends its own roster, and hands the give-up decision to `Watch` as `onGiveUp`.
-- The two announcements below are the seam a module hooks to learn that a gate
-- has closed or opened without core having to know that module's name.
