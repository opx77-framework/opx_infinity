--- Server half: the stores, their buckets, and the three placement commands.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- WHAT IS DECIDED HERE IS ONE THING: which stores a player may see. The client
-- draws markers from a list it is sent and asks for that list again on its own
-- cadence; this half filters it to the connection's own routing bucket and sends
-- it. Nothing is charged, created or destroyed, so there is no request to answer
-- and no verdict to publish -- the dressing happens in the fitting room, which
-- `appearance` owns.
--
-- NO CAPTURE ROUND-TRIP, unlike the garages. `add` needs a position and nothing
-- else, and a position is the one thing the server can read for itself
-- (`Open77.players.position`): the garages ask their own client back for a
-- HEADING because a chat line has no facing and a vehicle needs one. A store has
-- no facing -- so the ask, the answer, its deadline, the warning for an answer
-- that never came and the ACL check on the answer's own door are all machinery
-- this module does not have.
--
-- `character` is not required and not consulted. A store belongs to no
-- character: ownership is the fitting room's question, asked by the module that
-- owns the puppet.
