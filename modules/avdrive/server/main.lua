--- Server half: the autopilot itself -- one flight per pilot, posed by this file
--- and handed back at the hover.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- THE FLIGHT IS POSED, NOT SIMULATED. `Open77.vehicles.setTransform` per tick
-- is the primitive: server-authoritative, revoking the physics lease and
-- republishing the canonical transform to every viewer, which is exactly the
-- route `modules/ncpd/server/av.lua` flies the MaxTac insertion on. There is
-- no engine task for an AV (`Open77.vehicles.ai` does not support them), so
-- the three legs below ARE the flight model: climb over where you are, cruise
-- straight to the pin, descend to a hover above it. Each leg is eased at both
-- ends so the phase boundaries read as one continuous flight rather than three
-- snaps.
--
-- FROZEN FOR THE WHOLE RUN, AND THE FREEZE IS THE RIDE. A seated player in an
-- AV is its pilot as far as the platform is concerned: their client claims the
-- hull and reports its own poses. Left alone, that client and this file would
-- be two hands on one airframe -- the fight `av.lua` documents and refuses to
-- have. `setFrozen` is the platform's own referee: while the bit is up, the
-- physics owner's transform reports are DISCARDED rather than merged ("kept,
-- not punished" in the host's own words), so the pose this file publishes is
-- the only pose there is and the pilot rides instead of wrestling. The bit
-- comes off the moment the run ends, and the platform then hands the airframe
-- to whoever is seated in it -- the same hand-over rule, in the other
-- direction.
--
-- THE SEAT READ IS THE ONLY PROOF. What a toggle claims is nothing; what a
-- body holds is `getPlayerSeat`, and the run checks it every tick. A pilot who
-- leaves the seat, an aircraft taken out of the world, a pilot who vanishes --
-- each ends the run by name, unfreezes the hull and stops posing. Nobody is
-- ever left frozen in mid-air under a controller that has stopped caring.
--
-- NOTHING HERE IS OWNED. This module creates no vehicle, writes no row and
-- moves no player. It reads the host's own seat and hull reads, poses a hull
-- somebody else created, and puts both hands back on the controls at the end.
