--- The clinic's server half: the chair, the ledger, and every decision about
-- chrome. One authority -- the page a player presses is a picture of what this
-- half already said.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- THE TRANSACTION IS THE PLATFORM'S OWN RULE, FOLLOWED EXACTLY. Reserve the
-- price before submission, finalize only on a completion that says
-- `result.ok == true`, compensate anything else. So `settle` takes the money,
-- stages the work and keeps ITS OWN record beside the platform's ticket -- and
-- `onCompleted` is the only place a staged charge is kept or given back. A
-- refund is owed to the CHARACTER that paid, not to whoever holds the slot by
-- then: it is credited to that character wherever they are, or queued and paid
-- the next time they load.
--
-- A TICKET IS PENDING WORK, NEVER A PURCHASE. The staged response says
-- `{ok=true, ticket=...}` and the work lands later, as a server-local event
-- that names the player the way the host names them (a string). A ticket that
-- is not OURS is left alone -- "never consume someone else's ticket".
--
-- THE TRAY IS A BODY, NOT A LIST. Every piece belongs to one of the base
-- game's body systems, each with its own slot count, and the whole body has a
-- CAPACITY (`module.lua`). An offer is refused -- in words -- when the system
-- is full, when the platform slot or the grant it needs is taken, or when the
-- chrome would not fit; an upgrade trades the fitted grade in. Four kinds of
-- piece, two paths: a platform implant is STAGED and settled by the completion,
-- and everything the ledger holds (grants, stat chrome, roleplay chrome) is
-- fitted on the spot, because there is nothing to stage and nothing to roll
-- back.
--
-- "NOT READY" IS DIAGNOSED, NOT SHRUGGED AT. The platform answers `current`
-- nil while a record is loading, projecting or restoring -- and for ever when
-- no character was bound, when the support resource is stopped, or when a
-- restore timed out. Every one of those looked the same to a patient ("the
-- record is not ready") and left nothing in the journal. Now the refusal says
-- which it is, the journal carries both halves (the server's binding and the
-- patient's own client projection, asked for over PROBE), and a binding that
-- is stuck is bound again.
--
-- THE SEATS HEAL THEMSELVES, AND ARE ALSO TOLD. Every seat is reaped on touch
-- (a chair whose bodies are gone is a free chair), and a disconnect or a
-- character put down frees theirs at once.
