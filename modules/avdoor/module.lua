--- The AV door: board a parked aircraft you may fly, step out of it cleanly,
--- and hear a MaxTac AV that a player flies.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- THE BASE GAME HAS NO WAY INTO AN AIRCRAFT. V boards an AV in a scene, never
-- through an interaction, so a hull that is standing on a pad or a rooftop has
-- no "enter" choice on it at all -- which is why every AV in this resource used
-- to be boarded exactly once: by the pad's hand-off the moment it was recalled
-- (`modules/garages`), or through the MaxTac crew door during the insertion's
-- twenty-second hold (`modules/ncpd/server/av.lua`). This module is the door
-- the aircraft never had, for all of them.
--
-- THE SERVER FINDS AND DECIDES. Only the server holds a vehicle's world
-- coordinates -- a client snapshot deliberately carries none
-- (`wiki/vehicles.md`, "Client snapshot fields") -- so the server measures
-- every player on foot against every aircraft in their bucket, judges the
-- nearest one in reach from its own reads (the hull's canonical transform, the
-- asker's position, bucket, seat and life, the vehicles module's owner and job
-- books, and any rule another module registered for the hull through `Allow`),
-- and tells that client which door is open to it. The row is drawn from that
-- word alone, and the press is judged again from scratch before
-- `warpPlayerIntoVehicle` is called: the row is a hint, never a permission.
--
-- NOTHING HERE OWNS A VEHICLE. No hull is created, stored or removed by this
-- module; it reads other modules' books and seats a player through the
-- platform's own mount.
