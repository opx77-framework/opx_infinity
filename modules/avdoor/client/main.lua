--- Client half: the row at an aircraft's door, the key, the exit -- the fade and
--- the guard that stands the body beside the door -- and the MaxTac AV's voice
--- for everybody near it.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- THE ROW IS THE SERVER'S WORD. The server is the only side that knows where
-- an aircraft stands (a client vehicle snapshot carries no world position), so
-- it measures this body against every aircraft in its bucket and says which
-- door, if any, is open to it (`DOOR`). The row is drawn from that word and
-- taken down the moment the body is seated or a menu holds the keyboard; the
-- key sends the hull's id and nothing else, and the server judges it again
-- from scratch. The server swings the seat's door before it seats the body, so
-- the press is answered (`BOARDED`) about half a second later.
--
-- THE EXIT. The platform carries the body out of an AV in one cut (its
-- animated exit crashed the game and is switched off in its own client) and,
-- measured in the client log of 2026-09-29, it does so INSIDE the hull: the
-- engine drops the body at the cockpit's exit point, the chassis wakes and
-- knocks the body down at +0.4 s, and the platform's own deferred eject sets
-- it 3.5 m behind and 2 m UNDER the hull's centre at about +1.7 s. So the
-- moment a seat in an aircraft starts to empty this half
--   1. covers the screen with the native quest fade (`EXIT_FADE`);
--   2. puts the body on the ground beside its seat's door, on the ground the
--      static ray finds there, and puts it back if the platform moves it
--      (`EXIT`, the guard);
--   3. keeps the screen covered until the body has been still for
--      `EXIT.SETTLE_MS` -- the player never sees a throw or an eject.
-- The server opens that door for everybody as the seat empties. The hull's
-- place is the frame it FLEW at, read while the body was aboard (`keepFlown`):
-- an exit un-masks a hull flown off its pad and the engine drags it back to
-- where the flight began for a fifth of a second, so its frame at that instant
-- is not where the body stepped out.
--
-- THE WATCH. Every client measures where it draws each nearby aircraft it does
-- not simulate against the server's newest sample of it, and tells the server
-- when the two part (`WATCH`, see `M.Sight`), so a drift on somebody else's
-- screen is a line in the server's journal and not only a report.
--
-- THE VOICE. While this client is the one flying a MaxTac AV (its seat is in
-- the hull and the hull is simulated here), the flight is read four times a
-- second -- the seated body's height over the ground under it
-- (`Open77.world.groundZ`) and the climb rate -- and the three moments the
-- base game gives that aircraft a voice for (lifting off, coming down to land,
-- touching down) are sent to the server, which sends every listener near the
-- hull the sound to play on the airframe -- this pilot included. Every
-- listener's client answers what it did with the sound (`PLAYED`), and the
-- answers are the server's evidence of who heard it.
