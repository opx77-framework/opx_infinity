--- Server half: which aircraft door is open to which player, the mount itself,
--- and the relay that lets everybody near a player-flown MaxTac AV hear it.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- ONE VERDICT, TWO DOORS. `M.Verdict` is the whole decision -- the hull, the
-- body, the distance, the speed, the authority and the seat -- and both the
-- scan (which decides whether a client draws a row) and the key (`BOARD`,
-- which seats) go through it, so the row and the seat can never disagree about
-- who may fly what. Every read is the server's own: the hull's canonical
-- transform, the asker's position and bucket from the host, the seat ledger,
-- the life state, the vehicles module's owner and job books, and whatever rule
-- the module that owns a hull registered.
--
-- THE SCAN IS HERE BECAUSE THE COORDINATES ARE HERE. A client snapshot of a
-- vehicle carries no world position (`wiki/vehicles.md`: "Client snapshots do
-- not include server ownership metadata such as `resource`, `bucket`, or world
-- coordinates"), so a client cannot tell which hull it is standing beside.
-- Every `SCAN_MS` this half lists the aircraft once, measures each player on
-- foot against the ones in their bucket, judges the nearest in reach, and
-- sends that client a `DOOR` only when its answer CHANGED.
--
-- WHO MAY FLY WHAT, in the order it is asked:
--   1. a rule another module registered for this hull (`Allow`) -- the MaxTac
--      insertion parks its aircraft here once its crew stepped out, and its
--      rule is the division's own duty rule;
--   2. the character the vehicles module says owns it (a hull a pad ISSUED);
--   3. a job aircraft: the character it was signed out to, or an ON-DUTY
--      holder of the job it belongs to -- a crew flies its own division's bird;
--   4. with `PASSENGERS`, anybody who did not pass 1-3, into a free PASSENGER
--      seat of an unlocked hull -- a rule or a book that refuses somebody the
--      controls does not refuse them a seat beside them, unless the rule says
--      `passengers = false`.
-- Anything else is refused by name.
--
-- THE DOORS. The seat's door (`DOORS`) is opened here, on the server, because
-- a door the server opens is canonical and replicated to every viewer -- the
-- platform's own exit opens the pilot door as a LOCAL actuation that a parked
-- owner is supposed to report, and the exit that opens it is the very thing
-- that drops that owner. A door this half opens it owes a closing: every open
-- door is in a ledger with the time it closes, and `Stop` closes what is left.
--
-- THE SOUNDS are sent to the listeners near the hull, who say what they did
-- with them; a listener the host refused is rescued through the platform's own
-- fan-out. Both halves of that talk go to the journal.
