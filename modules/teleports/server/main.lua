--- Server half: the refusal, the move, and whether the body actually arrived.
-- @author dop42
--
-- THIS FILE IS THE GATE. A client sends a KEY and a LEG -- two strings, nothing
-- else -- and every other fact in the decision is read here: the destination out
-- of this VM's own copy of `config/teleports.lua`, the job out of the character
-- contract, the position and the routing bucket out of the host. A client that
-- can name a coordinate is a client that teleports anywhere, so it never gets
-- to name one; a client that hides its own prompt has hidden a prompt and
-- passed nothing. `modules/elevators/server/main.lua` refuses a floor the same
-- way, and the resemblance is deliberate.
--
-- WHAT IS CHECKED, IN THIS ORDER, and the order is not arbitrary -- the cheap
-- refusals come first so a client hammering the event pays nothing:
--
--   1. the per-player request window     (a counter, no reads)
--   2. one trip at a time                (a table lookup)
--   3. the destination exists            (`Access.Lookup`: key, leg, and the
--                                         back leg of a one-way)
--   4. the job gate                      (the character contract, re-derived)
--   5. not downed                        (the downed contract, if present)
--   6. standing on the entrance          (the host's own position and bucket)
--   7. the platform can move a body      (the native is there)
--
-- WHAT THE PLATFORM GUARANTEES ABOUT ARRIVAL, because the whole shape of `move`
-- below follows from it. `Open77.players.teleport` answers a PROMISE. It changes
-- the bucket, fades, issues the move, and then watches the client: the body must
-- be within 4 m horizontally and 6 m vertically of the mark, grounded, and in no
-- fall state, for three consecutive frames. While the body is on the point but
-- sinking -- an unstreamed floor -- it re-issues the teleport every 250 ms for up
-- to seven seconds, which is what keeps Cyberpunk's own
-- `PlayerTeleportationIfFallsUnderWorld` failsafe from yanking the player
-- kilometres away to the save's spawn of record with nothing told to anybody.
--
-- IT DOES NOT GUARANTEE ARRIVAL, and cannot: there is no streaming query
-- anywhere in the engine surface Open77 can reach, so "is the destination
-- loaded?" is not a question that can be asked. The promise RESOLVES `settled`
-- (all three tests held) or `near` (on the point, never reported grounded --
-- an honest success with a weaker claim, a mark on a prop or a very slow
-- stream-in), and REJECTS with `settle_timeout` when the body never stood there
-- inside the budget. So this half awaits the promise instead of assuming, and a
-- rejection is reported to the player as a failed trip AND logged against the
-- destination key -- because a destination that reliably times out is a
-- destination with nothing under it, which is an operator's bug and not a
-- player's.
