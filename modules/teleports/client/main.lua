--- Client half: the markers, the strip row, the key and the answer.
-- @author dop42
--
-- EVERYTHING DRAWN HERE IS A HINT. The marker says a shortcut is there, its
-- colour says whether the server thinks this character may take it, and the row
-- says which key to press. None of the three is a gate: the server re-derives
-- the destination, the job and the distance when the key is pressed, and a
-- client that flipped every `allowed` in its own copy would have recoloured some
-- markers and changed nothing else. See the head of `server/main.lua`.
--
-- THE LIST COMES FROM THE SERVER AND NEVER FROM `config/teleports.lua`
-- DIRECTLY, even though this half can read that file. The server filters it to
-- this player's own routing bucket and marks each entrance allowed or refused
-- against a character snapshot only it can read -- so a client reading the
-- config would draw markers in buckets it is not in and would have to invent its
-- own answer to the job gate, which is the second copy of a rule this whole
-- module was written to avoid.
--
-- Markers are engine primitives, so nothing is redrawn per frame: one is created
-- when an entrance comes into range and removed when it leaves. A marker whose
-- LOCK STATE changed is removed and remade, because the style is fixed at
-- creation -- that is the one case `reconcile` cannot handle by leaving a marker
-- alone.
--
-- Creation is guarded: `Open77.markers` may not be installed at all, and a raise
-- inside the scan would take the whole pass down with it and leave the last set
-- of markers on screen for ever.
