--- Where a brand new character starts: the catalogue, and the one thing it owns.
-- @author dop42
--
-- WHAT THIS MODULE OWNS, and nothing else does: the list of places a player may
-- start, the choice a player makes between them, and the deadline that ends a
-- choice nobody makes. It does NOT own placement. `character` does, and always
-- has -- a placement is a kill followed by a respawn, and the gate, the buckets,
-- the fade and the stored-position rule all live on that side of the seam. So
-- this module decides WHERE and `character` performs the move:
--
--   character.PlacePending   ->  spawn.Offer(source, citizenId)
--   the player clicks        ->  the wire -> spawn's server half
--   spawn                    ->  character.PlaceCharacter(player, point)
--
-- The dependency runs that way round and deliberately not the other: `spawn`
-- requires nothing, and `character` reaches for this module through
-- `OPX.Api.Get('spawn')` at the moment it needs it. Declaring the dependency in
-- both directions would be a cycle, which the registry refuses at boot.
--
-- WHY THE CATALOGUE IS SHARED RATHER THAN SENT. `config/` is a shared script, so
-- both halves already hold the same list, and the server is still the only
-- authority on it: a client sends the ID of a spot and the server looks that ID
-- up in its own copy for the coordinates. Sending the whole list down the wire
-- would be the same data twice, and the page would then be able to draw a spot
-- the server has never heard of.

	id = 'spawn',

--- Every event name this module raises.
-- Four across the wire and one on this VM's public bus. There is no intra-VM
-- channel: both halves of this module talk over the wire and nothing here is
-- private. The host dispatcher matches on the name alone, so a verb repeated
-- across channels would be a re-entrant handler; no verb below is.

	-- Server to client. "Pick one, and you have this many milliseconds."
	OFFER = OPX.Event(NET, 'spawn', 'offer'),
	-- Server to client. The choice is over, whichever way it ended, and every
	-- reason the menu comes down arrives on this one name with a reason on it.
	-- A second name per outcome would be four handlers on the page for one view.
	CLOSE = OPX.Event(NET, 'spawn', 'close'),
	-- Client to server. Every payload on it is attacker-controlled; only
	-- `source` is not, and the id is looked up rather than trusted.
	CHOOSE = OPX.Event(NET, 'spawn', 'choose'),
	-- Client to server. "The menu is on screen now." THIS IS WHAT STARTS THE
	-- COUNTDOWN, and it exists because the choice is deliberately deferred while
	-- the entry module is asking its own question -- a brand new character is
	-- asked for a name and a spawn at the same moment, and two modals on one
	-- keyboard is one modal losing its focus.
	--
	-- Without it the server counts from the moment the offer was QUEUED, which is
	-- before anybody can see anything: measured on the live server, the offer was
	-- queued at 16:09:33 and the name form was answered at 16:10:14, so a
	-- forty-five second window left the player four seconds of menu -- and a form
	-- that ran a little longer than the window left them none at all. The window
	-- is the player's time to CHOOSE, so it starts when there is something to
	-- choose from.
	OPENED = OPX.Event(NET, 'spawn', 'opened'),

	-- THIS MODULE'S OWN STATE, ON THE LOCAL BUS, and the reason the header above
	-- is wrong about there being nothing to watch. It was: this menu only ever
	-- had to WAIT on somebody, and `entry` published what it was waiting behind.
	-- But the spawn menu is itself one of the three screens that owns the display
	-- at join -- the creator, the fitting room and this -- and the HUD must not
	-- draw over any of them. `entry` already says so for the other two; a module
	-- that stands aside for the whole join and then says nothing when its own
	-- turn comes is the one gap in that sequence.
	--
	-- Same shape as `entry:state` deliberately, so a listener holds one rule for
	-- both rather than a special case per publisher.

--- The three answers to "which world enters are offered the menu?".
-- @author dop42
--
-- A CLOSED SET, NAMED HERE RATHER THAN SPELLED OUT AT THE COMPARISON. The server
-- half branches on these three strings, the suite asserts against them and the
-- operator types one of them into `config/spawn.lua`; a literal `'never'` written
-- at each of those places is three copies of a value with nothing keeping them in
-- step, and a typo in any one of them is a branch that is simply never taken.
--
-- Declared in module.lua and not in the server half because the NAMES are shared
-- even though the decision is not: the client never reads a policy -- it draws
-- whatever offer it is sent -- but the tests load this file to name the values
-- they configure, and a vocabulary that lives inside the half it steers cannot be
-- named from outside it.
M.Policy = {
	-- Only a character that has never stood anywhere, which the row's own
	-- position is what decides: it is nil until the first save after the first
	-- placement, so this is "once per character, ever".
	FIRST = 'first',
	-- Every world enter, a returning character included.
	ALWAYS = 'always',
	-- Nobody, ever. No offer, no hold and no deadline: `character` places the body
	-- in the same tick, from the row.
	NEVER = 'never',

-- Answers the value itself rather than a boolean, so a caller reads
