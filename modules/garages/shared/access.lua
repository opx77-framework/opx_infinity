-- WHAT A SPOT IS, AND WHO DECIDES IT. The record, the two input shapes that
-- normalise into it, the marker look and the coordinate box are all
-- `lib/shared/spots.lua`, and this file only names this module's own words to
-- them: its noun, its two KINDs, its key width and its fallback marker. That is
-- not tidying. `modules/dealership/shared/access.lua` held 334 `diff`-clean
-- identical lines of it, and the two must agree exactly or a car bought at a
-- dealer cannot be recalled at the garage beside it.
--
-- WHAT IS STILL THIS MODULE'S. Everything below the vocabulary: which distances
-- and cadences it scans at, how long a capture may take, and what a broken one
-- of those reads as. Those are numbers about THIS surface, not about what a spot
-- is, and a shared file that owned them would be forcing a dealer and a garage
-- to poll at the same rate for no reason. The job fleet is this module's too --
-- `JOB_VEHICLES`, who may take which row out, below the AV annex.
--
-- Every value is coerced and never trusted: a coordinate that is a string, a
-- NaN, an unknown KIND or a radius outside the engine's range reads as a
-- warning at boot rather than a raise inside a scan or a network handler. Only X
-- and Y are ever measured against; Z is validated and then carried to the create
-- call.
