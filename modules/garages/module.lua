--- Garages and AV pads: a glowing marker you stand on to bring your own vehicle out.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- The client draws one marker per configured spot in the player's own routing
-- bucket, posts a prompt row while the player stands on one, and sends a
-- request when the key is pressed. The server re-derives everything it can
-- prove -- the spot exists, the player is within USE_RADIUS of the DECLARED
-- position, the bucket agrees, the character is loaded and the vehicle is
-- theirs -- and only then asks the `vehicles` contract to create it, AT the
-- spot and facing the spot's HEADING, never beside the player.
--
-- A GARAGE IS A KEY AND A GARAGE IS IN SEVERAL PLACES. Each of its locations has
-- a MENU point that opens the list of everything filed under that key, ONE ENTRY
-- point that takes a vehicle in, and an ordered list of EXITS a vehicle comes
-- out at -- the first one with nothing parked on it. When every exit is taken
-- the request is REFUSED and the player told so, rather than queued or dropped
-- on top of the car already there.
--
-- THE ONE KEY DOES TWO THINGS, AND ONLY THE SERVER DECIDES WHICH. At a menu
-- point the key opens the list. At an entry point, sitting in one of the
-- character's own vehicles, it puts that vehicle AWAY under the garage's key --
-- so it comes out at ANY location of that garage afterwards, which is the whole
-- of the rework. The seated question is answered by the host's own seat
-- assignment and the plate the `vehicles` contract holds, never by the client;
-- the client only chooses which of the two texts the row names.
--
-- A VEHICLE OF THEIRS THAT IS ALREADY OUT IS MOVED, NOT IGNORED. It used to be
-- answered with the id it already had -- `Ok`, "brought out", and an empty spot
-- in front of the player, because the car was on the other side of the map. The
-- `vehicles` contract recalls it to the named place instead, and refuses when
-- somebody is sitting in it.
--
-- What comes out is what the character already owns: this module spawns no new
-- vehicle and creates no row. A spot with nothing eligible answers a refusal
-- that says so, rather than handing out a car the player does not have.
--
-- The marker is the engine's own (`world.markers`), so there is no geometry of
-- our own to keep in step with a screen: the four styles and two shapes are the
-- ones the host accepts, and `config/garages.lua` picks one per kind.
--
-- `character` is required on both halves: on the server it is the only proof
-- of ownership, and on the client it is where the player's own position and
-- facing are read from.
--
-- `vehicles` is OPTIONAL and not required, because it is a server-only module:
-- requiring it took the whole client half down with it -- no marker, no row, no
-- key -- the moment the server half was the only half that existed. The server
-- asks for the contract in `Start` and refuses every request without it, which
-- is the same answer with a line that says why.
--
-- The strip is optional too: without `prompts` the markers still draw and the
-- command still works, and only the key row is missing.

--
-- An EXIT is deliberately NOT in this set: nothing is drawn at one and no key is
-- pressed on one. It is a place the server creates a vehicle at, and it belongs
-- to the location rather than to the set of things a player walks up to.
