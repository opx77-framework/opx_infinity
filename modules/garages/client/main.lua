--- Client half: the markers, the strip row, the key and the garage list.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- WHAT IS DRAWN HERE IS A HINT. The nearest point, the radius and the list all
-- decide only what this player is offered; the server re-derives the distance,
-- the bucket, the ownership and which exit is free before a vehicle exists.
--
-- The points come from the server and never from `config/garages.lua` directly:
-- the server adopts garages out of the legacy table as well as reading the file,
-- and it filters the list to this player's own routing bucket. A client that
-- read the config alone would miss every adopted garage and would draw markers
-- for a bucket it is not in.
--
-- TWO KINDS OF POINT, AND THE KEY DOES A DIFFERENT THING ON EACH. A MENU point
-- opens the list of everything filed under that garage's key, wherever it was
-- stored; an ENTRY point takes in the vehicle the player is sitting in. Which
-- one a marker is travels with it on the wire, so this half never guesses.
--
-- THE LIST IS ASKED FOR EVERY TIME IT OPENS and never cached. A roster held
-- between two opens is a roster that has missed a purchase, a sale, or the same
-- garage's other door being used by the same player a minute ago.
--
-- A JOB'S OWN VEHICLES OPEN THE LIST, under the job's name, when the server
-- sends any (`config/garages.lua` JOB_VEHICLES): each row's name is a catalogue
-- key read here in the player's language, and picking one asks for that fleet
-- row and never for a plate. Only a list that has them grows captions; every
-- other list is drawn exactly as it was.
--
-- Markers are engine primitives, so nothing is redrawn per frame: one is created
-- when a point comes into range and removed when it leaves. `reconcile` owns
-- that set for as long as the module is running, and `clearMarkers` empties it
-- on the way down; nothing else writes it. Creation is guarded -- the
-- `world.markers` API may not be installed at all, and a raise here would take
-- the scan down with it.
