--- Server half: the garages, what may come out of each, and where it comes out.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- Everything the client believes is re-derived here before a vehicle exists: an
-- ask is a hint, and the mask is these checks. The distance is measured across
-- the ground against the DECLARED position, exactly as the client measures it,
-- and the bucket must agree -- a marker drawn for another routing bucket is not
-- one a player can use.
--
-- This module creates no vehicle of its own: it hands the plate to the
-- `vehicles` contract, which re-proves the ownership from the character roster
-- before it moves anything. Two owners of the same question would be one too
-- many, and the plate is the one this half does not own.
--
-- A GARAGE IS A KEY AND THE KEY IS IN SEVERAL PLACES. What a player walks up to
-- is a POINT -- a menu point or a door -- and every point knows which garage it
-- belongs to and which of that garage's locations it is at. A vehicle is filed
-- under the GARAGE, never under a point, which is what makes storing at one
-- location and fetching at another one garage rather than two.
--
-- WHERE A VEHICLE COMES OUT IS DECIDED HERE AND NOWHERE ELSE. The location's
-- EXITS are tried in the order the operator wrote them and the first one with
-- nothing parked on it wins. When all of them are taken the request is REFUSED
-- and the player told so: the owner chose that over the two alternatives, which
-- are queueing the player behind a car nobody may move and creating a vehicle
-- inside the one already there.
--
-- THE PLACEMENT COMMANDS ARE GONE. `/opx.garages.add` and `.remove` wrote into
-- `opx77_garages`, so the shape of the world lived in a table nobody had a copy
-- of. A garage is written in `config/garages.lua` now. What did NOT go is the
-- READ of that table: see "the legacy adoption" below, which is the whole of the
-- migration and the reason removing the commands loses nothing.
--
-- Every value off the wire goes through `safe` before it reaches a format
-- string: a newline would forge a whole log line.

-- ── the legacy adoption ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

--- Turns one row of `opx77_garages` into a garage of one location.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- THIS IS THE WHOLE MIGRATION, and it is written as code rather than as a SQL
-- script for one reason: a spot in that table is a spot NOBODY HAS A COPY OF.
-- The commands that wrote it are gone, so without this every marker an operator
-- ever placed in game disappears the moment this version starts -- silently,
-- because an empty `GARAGES` block is a valid config.
--
-- A legacy spot was ONE POINT that did everything: you stood on it, pressed the
-- key, and the car appeared where you were standing. So it adopts as one
-- location whose menu, door and only exit are that same point, which is exactly
-- what it did before. The key is kept, which is what makes it seamless: a
-- vehicle's `garage` column already holds it, so not one row is rewritten.
--
-- It is READ-ONLY. Nothing writes to `opx77_garages` any more and nothing drops
-- it: an operator who has not yet checked their spots in can roll back to the
-- previous version and still have them.
