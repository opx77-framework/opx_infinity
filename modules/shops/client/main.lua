-- stands, it asks the server to open the room, and when the room closes it
-- reports WHICH SLOTS CHANGED -- the one fact the server cannot see for itself,
-- because `Open77.equipment.records` and the fitting room's own draft live only
-- here. Every other question -- the distance, the price, the money, the job --
-- is answered on the server, from its own tables. See `server/main.lua`.
--
-- THE SLOT LIST IS NOT COMPUTED HERE EITHER. It rides on `wardrobeClosed`,
-- published by the fitting room, which is the only place that holds both what
-- the player walked in wearing and what they walked out with. A shop that
-- re-read the body afterwards would be racing the clothing module's own save.

-- pressed My outfits and was told the screen did not exist. The `status` line the
