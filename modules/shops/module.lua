--- Clothing shops, the looks they carry, and the outfits a player keeps.
-- @author dop42
--
-- WHAT THIS MODULE IS. A place in the world that opens the fitting room and
-- sends a bill afterwards. It owns no garments and stocks nothing.
--
-- THE ONE FACT THAT SHAPES ALL OF IT: the clothing catalogue is CLIENT-ONLY.
-- `Open77.equipment.records` runs on the game thread and the dedicated server
-- has no equivalent -- `modules/appearance/server/main.lua` says so and refuses
-- to grow into membership validation. So the server cannot answer "is this
-- jacket real, and what is it worth". It can answer "you changed what is on
-- your legs", because the nine slot names are a closed set both sides share.
-- Hence a price per SLOT, and hence a bill that is COUNTED rather than looked
-- up. See `config/shops.lua`.
--
-- WHAT THE CLIENT IS TRUSTED WITH, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. It is trusted to say
-- which slots differ, because it is the only half that can see them. It is not
-- trusted with the price, the shop's reach, the player's money, or whether a
-- job may take a uniform -- all four are read on the server from its own
-- tables. A client that named a total would be a client setting prices.
--
-- THE CHARGE IS NOT ATOMIC WITH THE SAVE, and pretending otherwise would be
-- worse than saying so. Money lives on the character row and clothing lives in
-- its own table, written by `appearance` through a debounce this module does
-- not own; there is no transaction spanning the two. So the order is: the room
-- closes, the bill is taken, and a bill that CANNOT be taken is answered by
-- putting the old look back. Compensation, not atomicity. The window is the two
-- seconds of the clothing debounce and the honest name for it is a window.

-- has no such table. A test holds the two lists against each other so the

-- ── share codes ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
-- A CODE IS NOT A SECRET and is not built like one. It names a look, and a look
-- is public the moment somebody wears it down the street; the code exists so
-- one player can read it out to another, which is the whole of the design
-- brief. What it must survive is a person saying it aloud badly.
--
-- So the alphabet has no `I`, no `O`, no `0` and no `1`: the two pairs every
-- handwritten and spoken code loses. Reading is case-insensitive and ignores
-- dashes and spaces, because somebody WILL type it back with the dashes in the
-- wrong places.

	-- `I` as `1`, the way Crockford's base32 does -- but that mapping exists for
	-- alphabets which CONTAIN one of each pair, and this one contains neither.
	-- There is no correct target to map onto, so a guess here would silently
