--- Server half: the crates, the wire, the refill pass and the pay.
-- @author dop42
--
-- THE SERVER OWNS EVERY CRATE. It creates them, in the SITE's bucket and never in
-- the reporting player's -- the mistake `modules/elevators/server/main.lua:5-8`
-- already warns about for lifts, and the one `rp_nomade` makes for crates: it
-- creates them in the accepting driver's bucket, so nobody outside that instance
-- can ever see one and the race the whole feature is built on never happens.
--
-- Every value off the wire goes through `safe` before it reaches a format string:
-- a newline would forge a whole log line.
--
-- The shape is `modules/elevators/server/main.lua`'s, because that is this
-- resource's house pattern for a server-owned world thing: a table of what we
-- own, an explicit release that tells everyone who was told, a `forget` on
-- disconnect, and a periodic sweep. It teaches the two lessons this module needs
-- most -- verify against the host before committing, and release rather than keep
-- a half-good claim.
--
-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY NOT HERE:
--
--   `Open77.world.nearby` -- a CLIENT game native. On the server it answers
--   `part_layout_not_proven` and is not a proximity query at all.
--
--   `Open77.props.catalog()` -- always an empty table on the server, so a model
--   alias cannot be validated against a list. `probe` below validates it by
--   TRYING, once, at boot.
--
--   `Open77.props.remove`'s truthiness as a test of existence -- the server card
--   lists `not_found` while the client card says removing an already-gone prop
--   SUCCEEDS, and that contradiction is unresolved. Nothing branches on it here.
--
--   `Open77.kvp.compareAndSet` -- a real typed CAS and a genuine third belt, and
--   two are enough: the non-yielding claim guards our own table and the prop
--   `revision` guards the host's. A third store to keep in step is a third store
--   that can disagree with the other two.
