--- Hauling: server-owned crates, contested by everyone who can see them.
-- @author dop42
--
-- Crates stand at surveyed points. Every player in the site's bucket sees THE
-- SAME crates, because the server owns them: it creates them, it decides who got
-- one, and it puts them back when a carry ends badly. A player claims a crate,
-- carries it, loads it into a vehicle, drives it to one of the site's drop-offs
-- and is paid. A scheduler refills the points. There is no `/start`: the ALT
-- target eye on a crate is the entire entry to the job.
--
-- A PROP AND NOT A LOOT DROP, and the reason is one sentence: a loot drop cannot
-- be attached to anything. `Open77.loot.*` would have given a free vanilla prompt
-- and a pickup that is atomic by contract -- both real advantages, and both worth
-- less than "load it into the car", which is the brief. So `world.props`, which
-- this resource already declares at `open77.lua:479`, and
-- `players.animations.control`, also already declared. THIS MODULE NEEDS NO NEW
-- PERMISSION AND DECLARES NONE.
--
-- WHERE THE RACE IS WON AND LOST. Two players ALT the same crate in the same
-- tick. The server Lua runtime is single-threaded and coroutines interleave only
-- at a yield, so a read-then-write with nothing yielding between them is atomic
-- -- but that is an invariant of the RUNTIME, not of the code, and it is invisible
-- at the call site. One inserted `Wait`, one `:await()`, one `Open77.database`
-- call, one `Open77.world.groundZ` (which round-trips to a client), and two
-- players hold the same crate with nothing in the log to say so.
--
-- So the claim is one function, alone in `server/claim.lua`, whose body is Lua
-- table arithmetic and nothing else, with the rule written above it. Everything
-- expensive -- positions, reach, buckets, the revision read -- happens before it
-- or after it and never inside. It is backed by the platform's own
-- compare-and-swap: the prop's `revision` is read before the claim and handed to
-- `Open77.props.attach` as `expectedRevision`, so a binding that raced ours is
-- refused before any mutation happens.
--
-- CLAIMS EXPIRE, which neither shipped example does. Both release a claim only
-- on disconnect, so a player who claims and never finishes freezes a crate for
-- everybody for the life of the process -- and on a four-point site that is a
-- quarter of the job gone to somebody who alt-tabbed. The refill pass reaps.
--
-- `character` is required: a delivery that cannot be paid is not a job.
--
-- `target` IS THE ENTIRE ENTRY -- there is no command and no key -- and it is
-- still listed as OPTIONAL rather than required, which looks wrong and is not.
-- `modules/target` declares `side = 'client'`, so on the dedicated server it
-- rests in state `absent`; a hard `requires` on it would therefore mark THIS
-- module `unavailable` on the server, and the server half is where the crates
-- live. Optional gets the ordering -- the eye is registered before this module
-- starts -- without condemning the half that does not need it. The client half
-- says so once and stops when the contract is missing, which is the honest
-- failure: no rows, and a line saying why.
--
-- `progress`, `inventory` and `animations` are optional for ordinary reasons:
-- without the first the bars are invisible and the server still holds the clock,
-- without the second nothing asks whether a player has room, and without the
-- third nobody mimes carrying anything.

--- The host raises this when a prop this module owns loses or changes a binding.

-- So a carrier who simply gets in the car keeps the crate stuck to their chest
-- inside the cabin, and the load action -- which is the intended route into the
-- vehicle, and the thing that puts the crate in the bed where everyone can see
-- it -- is bypassed. The server half forbids it explicitly.
