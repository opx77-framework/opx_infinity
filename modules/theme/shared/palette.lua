--- One accent hex to the whole OPX ladder, and the bounds every knob is held to.
-- @author dop42
--
-- THE PAGE IS TOLD NUMBERS, NEVER CSS. Nothing this file produces is a string:
-- a colour crosses the wire as three integers and every other knob as one
-- number, and `design-system/theme.ts` is what turns them into
-- `rgb(...)`/`px`/`deg` and writes them onto the root. A theme that travelled as
-- text would be an operator-supplied string interpolated into a stylesheet,
-- which is the one shape this could have taken that has a hole in it. There is
-- no path from configuration to CSS syntax at all.
--
-- WHY A DERIVATION AND NOT TEN COLOUR FIELDS. `design-system/tokens.css` calls
-- its reds a LADDER, and the rungs are not ten independent choices: they are one
-- hue at five brightnesses plus two grounds, and the whole look depends on them
-- staying in that relation. An operator given ten pickers produces a ladder with
-- a bent rung and no way to see it; an operator given one hex cannot.
--
-- THE FACTORS BELOW WERE MEASURED OFF THE SHIPPED LADDER. Each rung was
-- converted to HSL and compared with `#ff3b47`: the hue is the same to within
-- 1.6 degrees on every one of them, the saturation is a fixed fraction of the
-- accent's and the lightness a fixed offset from it. So the derivation is not a
-- new palette theory -- it is the existing palette, restated as the rule it was
-- already following. Fed `#ff3b47` it reproduces the shipped ladder exactly on
-- red and green and to within 4/255 on blue, and the entire residue is that 1.6
-- degrees of hand-picked hue wobble. `tests/run.lua` holds that claim to 4.
--
-- NOTHING HERE IS THE DEFAULT. A knob the operator did not set produces no key
-- at all, so the page never overrides the property and the stylesheet's own
-- value stands. That is what makes an unconfigured server byte-identical to the
-- one that shipped, rather than merely close.

-- producer and the receiver, because two copies of a bound is one bound and one
-- bug: the server clamps what the operator wrote and the client clamps what

-- surface that looks wrong on someone else's machine.
--
--   plateAlpha       the ground under running type. tokens.css calls 0.78 "the
--                    floor for running text over gameplay" and it is right, but
--                    the floor is a JUDGEMENT about a street at night, not a
--                    constant -- a server whose look is darker is allowed one.
--                    0.20 is where a plate stops separating anything at all.
--   interlaceAlpha   the scanline. 0 turns it off, which is a real identity
--                    choice; the ceiling is low because this is a texture over
--                    live gameplay and at 0.15 it is a barcode.
--   tiltDeg          `--op-tilt`. 0 is flat, which surface.css already supports
--                    (a centred surface takes no tilt). Past 15 the far edge of
--                    a 340px toast is off the plane and the type goes soft.
--   cut*             the three chamfer sizes, in pixels, at the 6/12/20 ratio
--                    the design uses. The floor is 1px rather than 0 because
--                    augmented-ui needs a cut before it will draw a border at
--                    all and a 0 has not been measured on this build -- see
