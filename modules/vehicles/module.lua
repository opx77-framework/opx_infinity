--- Owned vehicles: registering one, bringing it out, putting it away, and

-- The plate is the identity, never the runtime id: a runtime id belongs to one
-- spawn and is recycled, a plate is the row. Ownership is proved against the
-- character the connection has loaded, and never against what the client claims.
--
-- `live` -- plate to runtime id and owner -- is what is out NOW, and it is
-- rebuilt empty on every reload: the host removes the vehicles this resource
-- created when it stops, so a carried table would name vehicles that are gone.
--
-- Only vehicles this module spawned have a row. One created by anything else
-- answers no plate at all, and nothing durable may be attached to it.
