local live

-- Plates a `M.Spawn` is part-way through, so a second one is refused rather than
-- creating a second car from the same row. SEPARATE FROM `live`, which means "a
-- vehicle is out" and is read for exactly that by six other functions: a plate
-- is claimed both when nothing is out (a fresh spawn) and when something is (a
-- recall, which puts the old one away first and leaves `live` empty while it
-- does), and neither state fits in there. Rebuilt empty by `Init` with `live`,
-- because a claim held across a restart would be a plate nobody can ever bring
-- out again.
local claiming

-- Plates an `M.Store` is part-way through. NOT `claiming`: a recall holds the
-- claim and then calls `M.Store` itself, so the two have to be separate sets.
-- Without it two stores of one plate -- a save pass finding the owner gone while
-- the departure sweep puts the same car away, or a STORE request landing inside
-- a recall -- both read the snapshot and both yield on the row, and the one that
-- lost the removal saw `remove` answer false for a car that was already gone: it
-- wrote OUT over the STORED the winner had just written, logged "could not be
-- removed", and told the player the store was refused. Rebuilt with `live`.
local storing

-- The last citizen id each connection had a vehicle out for. The character
-- module logs a player out on its own disconnect handler, which runs before
-- this module's -- this module requires it, so it starts after it and registers
-- after it -- so by the time the departure reaches here the contract no longer
-- names the character that left.

	--
	-- On the beside-the-player path that is survivable by luck: whichever thread
	-- the database answers first then runs the test, `vehicles.create` and the
	-- `live` write with nothing in between that suspends, so the second finds the
	-- car out. THE RECALL PATH IS NOT. A caller that names a place -- every
	-- garage marker, every pad, every dealer handover -- goes through `M.Store`,
	-- which clears `live` and yields, and then fetches again and yields again.
	-- The plate stands empty in the middle of that, the second thread walks
	-- through, creates a car and writes `live`, and the recaller wakes and
	-- creates another over the top. Two cars from one row, and the first is
	-- ORPHANED: `live` holds one entry per plate, so nothing knows it exists and
	-- nothing will ever put it away, save it or remove it.
	-- `modules/garages/server/main.lua:330` names this race; this is it shut.
	--
	-- A SEPARATE TABLE AND NOT A PLACEHOLDER IN `live`. `live` means "a vehicle
	-- is out" and six other functions read it for exactly that; a plate can be
	-- claimed while nothing is out (a fresh spawn) and while something is (a
	-- recall, which puts the old one away first), and neither is a state `live`
	-- can express without every one of those readers learning about it.
	--
	-- CLAIM FIRST, THEN DO THE WORK, the shape `modules/hauling/server/claim.lua`
	-- uses: there is no yield between the test and the write, so two threads
	-- cannot both pass it. From here to the end of this function EVERY exit goes
	-- through `done`, or a spawn that failed locks the plate for the session.
	--
	-- The three doors in (`vehicle.spawn`, `garages.bring`, `dealership.buy`)
	-- still hold three separate per-player cooldowns, and deliberately: they are
	-- three operations an operator prices separately, and a per-player floor was
	-- never the right shape for this anyway. The thing that must not be done
	-- twice is a PLATE, and that is what is claimed. It is taken above.

	-- ── already out: recalled to the named place, or answered as it is ────
	-- WHAT HAPPENS NEXT IS THE WHOLE OF A MARKER'S PROMISE. Answering `Ok` with
	-- the id the vehicle already has, while it sits on the other side of the map,
	-- is a marker that spawns nothing and says it did: the player is told "brought
	-- out", stands there looking at an empty spot, and presses the key again.
	-- That is the bug this block exists for.
	--
	-- So a caller that NAMED a place -- a garage marker, a pad, a dealer handing
	-- a bought car over -- gets the vehicle THERE: it is put away first, which is
	-- what writes its condition back, and created again below, on the marker and
