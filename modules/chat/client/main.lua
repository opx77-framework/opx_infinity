-- answers `chat:ready` with every command a player may be shown, each with a
-- localised help string and its parameter tables, and that is the one payload
-- on this seam whose size grows with the RUNTIME rather than with anything a
-- player did: 73 commands today, and nothing stops the next module adding ten.

-- and the whole list is nine payloads on local IPC, twice a session.
