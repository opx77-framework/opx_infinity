--- The other half of the seam: the module's state on one side, the page on the other.
-- @author dop42
--
-- `client/main.lua` owns the chat's state and draws nothing. It says everything
-- it has to say on `M.Event.VIEW` and takes everything back through
-- `M.FromView`. This file is the only thing that knows those two ends are a CEF
-- page, which is what lets the state half stay testable without one.
--
-- ONE CHANNEL, NOT ONE PER VERB. Every other view in this runtime takes a
-- channel per verb -- `opx:form:open`, `opx:form:close` -- and this one does not,
-- because the seam it bridges is already a single event carrying a `kind`.
-- Splitting it here would mean a switch in this file and a second switch on the
-- page, both of which would have to be kept in step with a list that lives in a
-- third place. The payload travels as it was published.
--
-- THE KEY IS OURS NOW. The chat module listens for `open77:chat:open`, which is
-- raised by the platform's `open77_chat` -- a resource this server does not load,
-- and the reason the box has never opened and never appeared in the pause menu's
-- shortcuts tab. Registering a mapping here and raising that same event is all
-- that was missing: the state half is not touched, and if `open77_chat` is ever
-- loaded again both keys reach the same handler.

local M = OPX.Modules.Get('chat')

M.View = {}
local View = M.View

-- The surface the page draws on. There is one surface; the name a caller passes
-- is the LAYER hint the page reads off the payload, so the log and the input
-- line travel under their own names and resolve to the same page.
local SURFACE = 'interactive'

-- What a published payload travels on, and what the page answers with.
local CHANNEL = 'chat:view'

-- The mapping id the pause menu lists. Namespaced and stable: a rebind is stored
-- under it, and renaming it loses every player's rebind.
local KEY_ID = 'opx.chat.open'

-- The key the host answered with at registration, or nil.
local bound = nil

-- What this module answers for on `focus:set`, and what it asks for when it does.
--
-- THE KEYBOARD IS NOT HANDED OVER BY ASKING THE PAGE. `focus:set` is a BROADCAST:
-- the page announces that its own stack changed, and every view module on this
-- surface answers for ITS OWN owner by calling `OPX.UI.AcquireFocus`. Nothing
-- else calls it, so an owner no module claims is an owner nobody acquires --
-- `OPX.Surface.Focus` is never applied and the game keeps the keyboard.
--
-- That is not hypothetical: it is what this file shipped without, and the box
-- opened over a keyboard the player could not type into.
--
-- `cursor = false`, like the form and unlike the menu. This is one text line; the
-- pointer has nothing to do here, and taking it would put a cursor on screen and
-- stop the player turning while they talk.

--- Declares the open key. A refusal costs one log line and nothing else.
-- Two answer shapes are documented for `RegisterKeyMapping` -- the key guide
-- answers `true, key` and the API reference answers the key alone -- and either
-- is a registration. `false` or nil with a reason is a refusal.

		-- A key pressed while another surface holds the keyboard -- a form, the

-- Answers the surface-wide focus broadcast for this module's own owners.
--
-- THE BROADCAST NAMES THE WHOLE STACK'S TOP, NOT JUST "EMPTY OR NOT", and
-- reading only the empty case was the incomplete half of this idiom.
-- `ui/src/bridge/focus.ts` announces on EVERY change to the page's focus stack,
-- carrying the one owner now on top -- so a top that moved from one of OURS to
-- somebody else's arrives here as `focus = true` with an owner this module does
-- not know, and the old shape did nothing at all with that. The stale Lua entry
-- then sat above the module actually on screen and `applyFocus` applied ITS
-- wants: the chat line's `cursor = false` over the inventory's `cursor = true`,
-- with the inventory drawn and the cursor gone.
--
-- The answer is the same in all six copies: release every owner of mine that is
-- NOT the announced one, then acquire the announced one if it is mine. `form`,
-- `menu` and `panel` are saved from the worst of it by an explicit
-- `ReleaseFocus` on their close paths; `chat` and `downed` have none, so for
-- those two this handler is the only release there is.
