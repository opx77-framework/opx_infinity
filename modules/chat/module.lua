--- The chat box: what players say to each other, and the only path a typed
--- slash command takes to the host dispatcher.
-- @author dop42
--
-- Without the client half below, every `RegisterCommand` in this runtime is
-- reachable only from the developer terminal: the host has no in-game command
-- line of its own, and a line typed into a chat box is the only thing that ever
-- reaches `open77:command:execute`.
--
-- The module implements no command, checks no permission (the host resolves the
-- ACL before a handler runs) and persists nothing.
--
-- It draws nothing either. The client half owns the state and hands it to
-- whatever draws it, over the seam marked in `client/main.lua`. The log and the
-- input line are two concerns on two different surfaces -- the log on the
-- always-on overlay, the input line on the interactive layer that takes the
-- keyboard -- so every payload names the surface it belongs to.

	-- `downed` is not a requirement: without it the box simply never hides. With
	-- it, the box gives the keyboard back while a player is down.
	-- `character` is not one either: a runtime without it is one where the

	-- but with it, a message is attributed to the person, not to the account.
