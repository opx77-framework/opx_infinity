--- Samples the player, decides every tone, formats every number, and pushes the
--- seven overlay channels the HUD page draws.
-- @author dop42
--
-- THE PAGE DECIDES NOTHING. Two rules follow from that and they are the whole
-- shape of this file:
--
--   * a gauge's `tone` arrives decided. The thresholds are configuration, and a
--     page that coloured its own gauge would be a second opinion about the
--     player's health;
--   * a read-out's `value` arrives formatted. Separators, currency symbols and
--     rounding are decisions too.
--
-- Labels go the other way: they travel as CATALOGUE KEYS and the page resolves
-- them against the catalogue it was handed at boot, because a page that cannot
-- call back for a string per render still has to speak the player's language.
--
-- EVERY PUSH IS CHANGE-GATED. `hud:vitals` runs at the surface's own 30 fps, and
-- a channel at 30 Hz that re-sends an identical frame is pure cost. Each channel
-- keeps the signature of what the page last accepted; a send that did not land
-- forgets it, so the next pass tries again rather than believing the page is
-- showing something it never received.
--
-- AND THE GATE IS AHEAD OF THE BUILD, not only ahead of the send. A signature is
-- a concat over a table this file just allocated, so a channel gated only at the
-- send still paid to discover it had nothing to say. `hud:vitals` is gated on the
-- sampled pools instead, which is three integers, and builds the column only when
-- one of them moved. See the job in `Start`.
--
-- Nothing here is authoritative and nothing here writes: no mutator, no database
-- and no event to the server.
