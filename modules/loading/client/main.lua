--- The read, the decision and the two places it is told: the page and the bus.
-- @author dop42
--
-- ONE JOB, AND IT IS CHEAP ON PURPOSE. The scheduler runs `pass` every
-- `POLL_MS`; a pass makes one host call and, when the `revision` it answers is
-- the one already acted on, returns. That is every pass but a handful per load,
-- so the standing cost of this module is one native read five times a second.
-- No thread of its own, no `while true`, nothing that can walk past the
-- per-resume instruction budget the header of `core/client/scheduler.lua`
-- warns about.
--
-- THE READER IS LOOKED UP ON EVERY PASS, NEVER CACHED. A client too old to have
-- it answers `unavailable` on the first pass, says so once in its own log and
-- the job is cancelled -- a module that can never learn anything stops asking.
-- `isLoading` alone (no table) is accepted as a poorer reader: it can hide the
-- views, and it can cover a load, but it cannot draw progress.
--
-- A READ THAT FAILS IS A LOAD THAT IS NOT UP. The two wrong answers are not the
-- same size: views shown over a loading screen for one pass are a blemish, and
-- views hidden for the rest of the session because a read stopped answering
-- are a HUD that is gone. So a refusal clears everything this module asked for.
-- `permission_denied` is permanent and also stops the job, with one line in
-- the operator's journal -- it is a client permission, so the player's log is
-- the only other place it would ever appear.
