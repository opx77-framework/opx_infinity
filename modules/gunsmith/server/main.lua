--- Registers the benches, answers the gate and opens the chests.
-- @author dop42
--
-- THIS FILE IS SHORT ON PURPOSE. Almost everything an armoury does is done by
-- two other modules: `crafting` holds the orders and `inventory` holds the
-- chest. What is left is the one question neither of them can answer -- whether
-- this character may work here -- and the wiring that puts the question in front
-- of them.
--
-- THE GATE IS A CALLBACK AND NOT A TABLE, which is what keeps the crafting
-- module ignorant of jobs. `crafting` calls `canUse(player, recipeKey)` when it
-- draws a row and again when it takes an order; the answer is decided here, from
-- this module's own config and the character contract's own roster. A design
-- that had handed crafting a JOBS table instead would have put a job gate in a
-- module that a cook and a ripperdoc also have to use.
--
-- THE SNAPSHOT IS STAMPED NOW. On this side there is no snapshot to go stale:
-- the roster is read out of the same VM at the moment the question is asked, so
-- `Evaluate`'s age test always passes and the staleness bound is really only
-- meaningful to a client drawing a picture. It is stamped rather than skipped so
-- the two halves run the same function over the same shape.

-- THE SHAPE THE CRAFTING CONTRACT ASKS FOR: `(player, recipeKey)` answering
-- `true` or `false, code`. A nil recipe key is "may they open this bench at
-- all"; a key is "may they order this one". The code it answers is a locale
-- key under `crafting.` -- see `modules/gunsmith/locales.lua`, which registers
-- the four sentences there and says why they live in another module's namespace.

--- Opens one armoury's chest beside the player's bag.
--
-- THE CHEST IS A STASH AND NOTHING HERE KNOWS WHAT IS IN IT. `OpenStash` is
-- documented to leave the "may this player open this" question to its caller --
-- "a job, a key, a code" -- and to check only the reach, which it does against
-- the position handed to it. So this function is the job half of that bargain
-- and the inventory module is the distance half, and neither duplicates the
-- other.
