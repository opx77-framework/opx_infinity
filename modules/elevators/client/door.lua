--- The way in: the key that opens the floor list, and the strip row naming it.

-- THE PANEL HAD NO DOOR. `Panel.Open` was published as `OpenPanel` on the
-- contract and nothing in this resource called it -- no key, no strip row, no
-- eye row -- while the server adopts every configured lift LOCKED, which is what
-- refuses the vanilla in-cabin button. So a configured shaft was a cabin no
-- player could ride at all: the game's own button was refused by design and the
-- replacement for it could not be reached. This file is that door, built the way
-- a garage, a dealer, a store and a teleport are built: a rebindable key
-- (`KEY` in `config/elevators.lua`, E out of the box) and a strip row while the
-- player stands within USE_RADIUS of a configured lift.
--
-- The row is a hint like everything else on this side: what the key opens is
-- the floor list, every row of it re-decided by the server before a cabin moves.
-- `prompts` is optional -- without it the key still opens the panel.
