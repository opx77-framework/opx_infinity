-- THE SHAPE IS `modules/teleports/client/main.lua`'s MARKER RECONCILE, and
-- deliberately so. A desired set is derived from the sources, the drawn set is
-- diffed against it, what is gone is removed and what is new is created. There
-- is no "add a blip" call anywhere: a blip exists because a spot exists, so a
-- spot that goes away cannot leave a pin behind, which is the failure mode this
-- kind of module has every single time it is written the other way round.
--
-- THE ONE THING THAT IS NOT LIKE THE MARKERS, AND IT IS THE IMPORTANT ONE.
-- `reconcile` YIELDS, every `BATCH` creations, on a thread of its own. See the
-- long comment at `apply()`. `modules/admin/client/target.lua` paid for that
-- comment four times.

--- Whether the local character passes one place's JOBS block.
--
-- THE OWNER: "fait en sorte que les blips job on les voit uniquement si on fait
-- partie du job si possible". It is possible, and it is possible WITHOUT a
-- second rule: `config/gunsmith.lua` and `config/hauling.lua` already say who
-- may use a place, in the same `JOBS` / `ON_DUTY` / `MEMBERSHIP` vocabulary that
-- `config/elevators.lua` and `config/teleports.lua` use, and one gate decides all
-- of them. So the map asks that gate. A pin appears for exactly the people the
-- bench would open for, and the two can never drift apart, because there is only
-- one of them.
--
-- A PLACE WITH NO `JOBS` BLOCK IS PUBLIC and stays pinned for everybody --
-- `Evaluate`'s first line, and the reason hauling's sample sites stay visible:
-- the owner asked for a job-free job, and "anyone may haul" must not read as
-- "nobody may see where".
--
-- THIS IS A VISIBILITY FILTER AND NOT A GATE, which inverts the asymmetry the
-- gate itself is built on. `jobgate.lua` closes on every doubt because granting
-- a gated surface costs the operator the gate. Here the cost runs the other way:
-- hiding a pin from somebody entitled to it is the failure, and showing one to
-- somebody who cannot use the bench is untidy at worst -- the server refuses
-- them at the bench either way, and nothing here decides anything. So every
-- doubt this side opens:
--
--   * no character API, no character yet, no snapshot -- pinned. A player
--     reading a map during a database hiccup is not a threat model;
--   * `MEMBERSHIP = 'any'` with a job held as a secondary membership -- pinned.
--     The client mirror carries the PRIMARY job and no memberships table, so
--     this side genuinely cannot answer, and it must not answer "no". Both
--     shipped configs say `primary` today, where the mirror is exactly enough.
--
-- The snapshot is stamped now because the mirror IS now: it is replicated, and
-- `character` raises `job` the moment it changes. Staleness is a server-roster
-- problem and stamping it honestly here would invent one.
