--- The crafting screen: a list of what can be made, and a shelf of what is cooking.
-- @author dop42
--
-- THIS HALF DRAWS AND NOTHING ELSE. Every row below -- its label, whether it is
-- greyed, the reason it is greyed, how long is left on an order -- arrives in
-- one payload the server built from the server's own tables. This file never
-- counts a bag, never reads a price and never decides that a craft is ready. A
-- client that did any of those would be a client whose screen disagrees with the
-- refusal it gets back, which is worse than a screen that says nothing.
--
-- THE SCREEN IS A `menu`, and that is the whole of the design language. The
-- resource already has one list widget, with a cursor, a breadcrumb, icons, a
-- status line and a greyed-row affordance; a second one built for crafting would
-- be a second thing to keep in step with the theme. What crafting adds is the
-- SHAPE of the list -- the shelf above the recipes, so the first thing a
-- returning player sees is the thing they came back for -- and the sentences.
--
-- WHY THE LIST IS REBUILT RATHER THAN ANIMATED. A cooking order's remaining time
-- is a number the server sent, so it is right at the moment it arrives and drifts
-- afterwards. `Update` keeps the cursor where the player left it, so a refresh
-- every few seconds costs them nothing and the countdown is never a local clock
-- inventing a readiness the database has not agreed to.

-- module's own dispatch rather than doing anything.
