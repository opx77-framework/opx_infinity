--- Every SQL statement crafting runs, and the one table it owns.
-- @author dop42
--
-- This is the only file in the module allowed to carry SQL, and a CI check
-- enforces it. Statements bind named parameters (`@citizen`), never `?`: the
-- bridge rewrites `?` by walking the query text. No comment may appear inside a
-- SQL string for the same reason. Every call yields, so every one of them has to
-- be reached from a `CreateThread`.
--
-- THE DATABASE OWNS THE CLOCK, AND THAT IS THE DESIGN AND NOT A CONVENIENCE.
-- An order's deadline has to be right while this resource is not running --
-- a craft started before a restart finishes during it -- so it cannot be
-- measured against `OPX.Now`, which is milliseconds since THIS process started
-- and resets to zero with it. It must not be measured against two clocks either:
-- the collection below is made exactly-once by a DELETE whose WHERE clause tests
-- the deadline, so if Lua decided readiness and the database did not, two
-- collections racing would both pass the Lua test and one of them would hand out
-- an order the other had already handed out.
--
-- So every wall-clock word in this file is MySQL's. Lua is handed and hands back
-- nothing but RELATIVE SECONDS -- how long until this is ready, how long to hold
-- this one for -- which is arithmetic `shared/recipes.lua` does in the open and
-- `tests/run.lua` checks without a database at all.
--
-- `ready_at` IS A `DATETIME` AND NOT A `TIMESTAMP`, which is the one column type
-- decision here that can go quietly wrong. A TIMESTAMP is stored as UTC and
-- CONVERTED to the session time zone on the way in and out, while `UTC_TIMESTAMP()`
-- is UTC whatever the session says -- so writing one into the other on a server
-- whose connection is not UTC shifts every deadline by the offset, and the craft
-- is ready an hour early or an hour late with nothing anywhere saying why. A
-- DATETIME stores the value it is given. The 2038 ceiling a TIMESTAMP carries is
-- the second reason and the smaller one.

--- The one table this module owns. `Init` hands it to `OPX.Schema.Add`.

-- The foreign key is on `citizen_id` and it declares `CHARACTER SET ascii
-- COLLATE ascii_bin` explicitly. It is not decoration: a referencing column
-- whose character set and collation do not match the referenced one is refused
-- by InnoDB with SQL error 1005, `ApplySchema` stops at the first failure, and
-- the whole boot comes up degraded over a default charset nobody typed.
--
-- ON DELETE CASCADE, because an order belongs to a character: a deleted
-- character's unfinished crafts are not somebody else's to collect, and the
-- citizen id is reissued to nobody.
