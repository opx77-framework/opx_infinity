--- The benches, the doors a client knocks on, and the one place an order is paid for.
-- @author dop42
--
-- EVERYTHING A CLIENT SENDS IS A NAME AND NOTHING ELSE: a bench key, a recipe
-- key, an order id. No cost, no duration, no yield and no position crosses the
-- wire in that direction, because all four are read here from tables a client
-- cannot reach. The screen is a renderer; `shared/recipes.lua` builds what it
-- renders, on this side, from what the bag and the purse actually hold.
--
-- THE MONEY IS THE CHARACTER MODULE'S AND STAYS THERE. `RemoveMoney` and
-- `AddMoney` through the contract, with a reason string, and no balance of any
-- kind is kept here -- a second ledger is how a framework loses the first one.
--
-- WHAT IS NOT ATOMIC, SAID OUT LOUD. Placing an order touches three things that
-- are not in one transaction: the bag, the purse and this module's table. The
-- order below is chosen so the compensation is always possible -- materials
-- first, because putting a stack straight back into the bag it just left cannot
-- fail for room; then the fee, which is one call with one inverse; then the row.
-- A failure at any step undoes the steps before it, in reverse, and the failure
-- of an UNDO is the one thing loud enough to be an `error` line naming exactly
-- what the player is owed.
