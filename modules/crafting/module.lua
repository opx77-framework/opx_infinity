--- Crafting: an order placed at a bench, collected later, by whoever owns the bench.
-- @author dop42
--
-- WHAT THIS MODULE IS, AND WHAT IT IS NOT. It is a shared service: a consumer
-- module registers a BENCH -- a place with a list of recipes and a gate of its
-- own -- and this module takes the materials, holds the order for as long as the
-- recipe says, and hands the output back when somebody comes to collect it. It
-- is NOT a trade. It knows nothing about gunsmiths, ripperdocs or cooks, it
-- never reads a job, and the one question it cannot answer -- "may this player
-- use this bench" -- is asked back to the consumer as a function.
--
-- THE ONE REQUIREMENT THAT SHAPES EVERYTHING: you start a craft and you walk
-- away. So an order is NOT a progress bar.
--
--   `modules/progress/` is the timed-action bar and it is the wrong tool here by
--   construction: it takes `Movement` and `Attack` off the player for the whole
--   duration, which is precisely what walking away is. It is right for the two
--   seconds of HANDING THE MATERIALS OVER and wrong for the twenty minutes
--   afterwards, and that is how it is used -- the bench plays a short bar while
--   the order is placed and owns nothing after it.
--
--   An order is a ROW WITH A DEADLINE. Nothing about it lives in a client, in a
--   Lua timer or in a table this module holds: the row is the order, the
--   database's own clock decides when it is ready, and this module is only what
--   reads and writes it. A player who walks off, shuts the screen, disconnects
--   or watches the server restart comes back to exactly the same row.
--
-- WHAT HAPPENS WHEN THE PLAYER LEAVES: THE ORDER KEEPS COOKING, and it is the
-- only answer that is not a theft. The materials were taken when the order was
-- placed -- see below -- so at the moment of the disconnect the server is
-- holding something of theirs. Cancelling would have to give it back, into a bag
-- that is no longer loaded, on a path that a crash can run twice; keeping it
-- costs nothing and is what the player expects of an order they placed. The row
-- is keyed on the CITIZEN ID and never on the connection slot, so it belongs to
-- the character rather than to the session, and a slot recycled to somebody else
-- reaches none of it.
--
-- MATERIALS ARE TAKEN WHEN THE ORDER IS PLACED, NEVER WHEN IT IS COLLECTED. The
-- alternative loses on both sides: a player could queue the whole bench off one
-- set of materials and then be refused at every collection, and the refusal
-- would arrive twenty minutes after the decision that caused it.
--
-- THERE IS NO CANCEL, DELIBERATELY. A cancel means a refund, a refund means
-- putting items back into a bag that may be full and money back into a ledger
-- this module does not own, and both have to be exactly-once against a row two
-- callers may reach at the same time. Nothing in the brief asks for one. An
-- order accepted is an order paid for, the way handing materials to a gunsmith
-- is, and the whole class of double-refund bugs never exists.
--
-- COLLECTION IS MANUAL, AT THE BENCH. A finished order is not pushed into the
-- bag when the clock runs out, because at that moment there may be no bag: the
-- character may be offline, or carrying too much. So the order waits on the
-- shelf, and the only thing that can fail is a collection -- which the player
-- can see, understand and retry.

--- Why a request was refused, as a CLOSED set.
--
-- Named here rather than spelled at each site, and kept short and machine-like,
-- because every one of them is also a locale key under `crafting.` -- the same

-- as `error.unavailable` with the real code logged, which is a safety net and
-- not a plan.
