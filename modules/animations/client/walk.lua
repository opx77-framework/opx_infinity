--- Walking while an emote plays, and giving the ability back.
-- @author dop42
--
-- WHAT THE PLATFORM ACTUALLY OFFERS, because the obvious name for this does not
-- exist. There is no `canWalk` flag on an animation anywhere in the catalogue.
-- What arrived in client 2.31.13+op77.75 is `Open77.movement.setWalkMode`, and
-- it is not a switch on the emote -- it is a LEASE ON THE LOCAL PLAYER, held by
-- a resource, asking their body to move at a bounded speed:
--
--   Open77.movement.setWalkMode(enabled, speed?)   -- players.controls
--
-- The platform's own words: "Every resource holds its own request and the
-- slowest live request wins; `false` releases only this resource's request and
-- never touches another's." Speed is 0.5 to 2.5 m/s.
--
-- THAT SHAPE IS WHY THIS IS SAFE TO USE AND DANGEROUS TO FORGET. Safe, because
-- another resource carrying a body at 1.0 m/s cannot be overridden by us asking
-- for 2.0, and we cannot be overridden either -- the slowest wins and every
-- release is private. Dangerous, because a lease is not tied to the animation
-- that justified it: if the emote ends and nothing releases, the player walks
-- for the rest of the session and has no idea why.
--
-- So there are two mechanisms here and not one. The lease is taken and released
-- on the state change, AND a watchdog re-checks every sweep that a held lease
-- still has an emote under it. The second exists because the first is a
-- promise about every exit path -- stop, expiry, death, a character change, the
-- resource stopping -- and a promise about every path is the kind that is kept
-- until somebody adds a path.

-- The speed the lease is currently held at, or nil when it is not held. The

-- native call a second for no reason.
local heldAt = nil

-- Named reasons this runtime wants a bounded walk, to the speed each asks for.
--
-- THE LEASE IS PER RESOURCE, NOT PER CALLER. The platform's rule -- "every
-- resource holds its own request and the slowest live request wins" -- arbitrates
-- BETWEEN resources. Inside one resource there is a single request, so two
-- reasons here would simply overwrite each other: an emote asking for 1.3 would
-- wipe out a player who chose to stroll, and releasing either would release
-- both. The same rule is therefore applied locally, over these names, and the
-- one number that comes out of it is the only thing `setWalkMode` ever sees.
