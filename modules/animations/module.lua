--- Emotes and animations: the commands, the picker and the animation contract.
-- @author dop42
--
-- This module is NOT the authority on what plays. The platform's animation
-- service owns every playback, replicates it to the bucket, and refuses a dead
-- player, a player in a vehicle or a second animation over another owner's, on
-- its own. All this module decides is what it ASKS the service for: the
-- catalogue as config leaves it, a per-player rate and a readiness gate. It
-- provides no animation of its own and writes nothing to the database.
--
-- The catalogue it offers is the rows written in shared/catalogue.lua AND the
-- platform's own catalogue, read at runtime from `Open77.animations.list`; and
-- an emote with a nearby player goes through the platform's two-player
-- coordinator, `Open77.playerInteractions`, after this module has asked the
-- other player and they have accepted.
--
-- `downed`, `menu`, `form` and `prompts` are optional. Without `menu` there is no
-- picker and the commands and the contract still work; without `form` the picker
-- keeps every screen and loses only its search box; without `prompts` the
-- stop key is simply not drawn; without `downed` the picker never closes itself.
-- Each absence costs one logged line and nothing else.

	-- `target` is optional too, and it is optional ON PURPOSE rather than
	-- required: a runtime without the eye is a runtime where the walking paces
	-- are unreachable, which is a missing convenience and not a broken module.
	-- But it MUST be named. `Resolve` orders modules by what they declare, so
	-- without this line nothing put `target` ahead of `animations` on the
	-- client, `OPX.Api.Get('target')` answered nil in `Walk.Start`, and the pace
	-- rows were never registered at all -- reported from the game the same hour
	-- they shipped.
	-- `character` names the two players of an emote with a nearby player by
	-- their characters rather than their accounts; without it, the account name.
