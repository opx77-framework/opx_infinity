--- The creator for a character with no body, and the form for one with no name.

-- the character bootstrap is still open, and the name to the world afterwards,
-- where a modal can be drawn at all.
--
-- Everything here is driven by one pass rather than by a thread. The per-resume
-- instruction budget unwinds out of a coroutine body, and a `while true` loop
-- that hits it is never resumed again, silently -- which here would mean a
