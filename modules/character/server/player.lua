-- A Player is a character that is in the world. `M.Players` is keyed by player id
-- and `M.Registry` is its reverse index, so that a lookup by citizen id or by
-- account is one hash read and never a walk.
--
-- A player id is recycled and a user id is durable, so a player id is only ever a
-- search key: every read re-checks the user id behind the slot. A departure
-- nobody reported becomes a non-event instead of a hole.
--
-- Sessions, the readiness gate and routing buckets belong to core: this module
-- owns the roster of loaded characters and nothing else about a connection.

-- WHO IS WRITING A CHARACTER'S ROW WHILE NOBODY IS PLAYING IT.
--
-- A loaded character is written from memory, whole: `Storage.Save` puts the
-- money column back as PlayerData holds it. So any write to the row that does
-- not go through PlayerData is lost the moment a login that read the row BEFORE
-- it saves AFTER it -- and a login yields three times between its read and the
-- roster. `AddMoneyOffline` is such a write, and so is a staff rename of a
-- character nobody is playing, and so is a job or gang change (groups.lua).
--
-- `busy` counts writers on the row right now and `seq` moves every time one
-- finishes. A login notes `seq` before it reads, waits for `busy` to reach zero
-- before it registers, and reads the row again when `seq` moved: what it then
-- puts in the roster is what is in the database. A logout counts as a writer
-- from the moment the character leaves the roster until its last save lands, so
-- an offline write that arrives during that save waits for it instead of being
-- written underneath it.
