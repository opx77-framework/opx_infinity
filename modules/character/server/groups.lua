--- Job and gang memberships, for characters online or offline.

-- Jobs and gangs are multi-membership: a character holds a grade in any number of
-- them and one of each is primary. Every function here yields when the character
-- is not in the world, so every one of them is coroutine only.
--
-- The definitions come from the module's own configuration. They are definitions
-- and not settings: the key is stored on the character's row, so entries are
-- added freely and never renamed.
