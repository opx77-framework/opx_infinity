--- The pop when noclip goes on and off, and the body it leaves behind.
-- @author dop42
--
-- WHAT THIS IS, IN FIVEM TERMS. `txadmin`'s noclip plays a "wizard" particle on
-- the ped both ways -- once on the way up and again on the way down -- and that
-- is the behaviour kept here: one effect per transition, in either direction,
-- and the body gone for as long as the operator is flying. What is NOT kept is
-- the asset: a FiveM resource is not something this build can load, so the pop is
-- a name out of the engine's own effect catalogue (`Open77.vfx.catalog()`) and
-- `config/admin.lua` moves it in one line.
--
-- WHY IT IS PLAYED IN THE WORLD AND NOT ON THE BODY. The obvious parallel to
-- `StartNetworkedParticleFxNonLoopedOnEntity` is `Open77.vfx.playEntity`, and it
-- is the wrong call here: `playEntity` resolves its name as a CName against the
-- RECEIVING ENTITY'S TEMPLATE, while `vfx.play` resolves a depot path at a
-- transform. Handing a curated alias such as `fire.large` to `playEntity`
-- therefore draws nothing at all -- the same conflation, already paid for once,
-- recorded in `docs/research/props-and-object-spawning.md` §6.
--
-- AND WHY IT IS THEN MOVED EVERY FRAME. A world effect is placed once and stays:
-- an instance spawned where the operator stood is behind a noclip flying at
-- 40 m/s inside a single frame, so the pop was drawn correctly and visible to
-- nobody -- which reads in game as "the pop does not show". `txadmin`'s particle
-- RIDES the ped, so this does the same by hand: the handle is re-placed at the
-- operator's feet until it expires. `vfx.update` takes the same position shape
-- as `play` and is refused for a handle this resource does not own, so the loop
-- stops on the first refusal instead of spinning at a dead handle.
--
-- ONE TRANSITION, ONE OWNER. `Controls` owns the noclip state on this client and
-- calls `Noclip.Changed` on both edges -- the server command that arms it, and
-- the native being switched off underneath us. Nothing else calls this file, so
-- the pop cannot play twice for one toggle.
--
-- EVERY OUTCOME IS ONE LOG LINE. A pop that drew, a pop the engine refused with
-- its reason, a client with no effect layer, an empty `EFFECT` and an operator
-- with no position YET are five different things, and a reader must not have to
-- guess which they have from an empty log.
--
-- THE BODY IS THE SERVER'S. Hiding a body is `Open77.players.setVisible`, on the
-- server only, so this half reports the one edge the server cannot see and the
-- server decides what the body of a flying operator looks like. That also keeps
-- the Invisible switch and this pop from fighting: both end in the same
-- server-side veil, and noclip only asks for its own reason on top of it.
