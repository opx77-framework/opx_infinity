--- The other half of the name tags: the state on one side, the page on the other.
-- @author dop42
--
-- `client/tags.lua` owns which tags exist and draws nothing. It says everything
-- it has to say on `M.Event.ON_TAGS` and this file is the only thing that knows
-- the other end is a CEF page with world anchors under it -- which is what lets
-- the state half stay readable without one.
--
-- A NAME TAG IS TWO THINGS AT ONCE, and that is the whole of this file:
--
--   1. A WORLD ANCHOR. `Open77.anchors` follows a streamed entity and projects
--      it on every game frame, which is not something Lua could do on a 250ms
--      scheduler pass without the tag swimming behind the body. `render =
--      'page'` publishes the projection to the surface as a batch, so the page
--      moves its own DOM and no coordinate ever crosses the Lua tick.
--   2. A ROW OF CONTENT. The name, whether they are staff, and the fade. That
--      travels on our own channel and changes only when `tags.lua` says the
--      frame changed -- which is a handful of times a minute, against sixty
--      projections a second.
--
-- The two are joined by the ANCHOR ID: `rows` carries one per row and the page
-- matches it against the batch. An id in the batch with no row is a body whose
-- tag has gone; a row with no projection is a body behind the camera, out of the
-- distance band, or not streamed -- the page draws neither.
--
-- THE 32-ANCHOR QUOTA IS THE PLATFORM'S, not ours: `Open77.anchors.create`
-- refuses past 32 per resource and 128 in all. `TAGS.MAX` is already clamped to
-- 32 in `tags.lua`, so a full frame spends the resource's entire quota and any
-- other world anchor this runtime ever wants would be refused. Nothing else asks
-- for one today; the day something does, this is where the budget is split.

-- follows the body itself and projects it on every game frame, and Lua is not in
-- that loop. The local body cannot be one -- its entity id is `0` and the backend
-- refuses it -- so its anchor is a fixed world point, and a fixed point does not
-- follow anybody. Without this the operator's own tag would hang in the air where
-- they were standing when the tag was made.
--
-- ONCE PER FRAME, and 80ms was not enough. It was a scheduler job at 80ms -- twelve
-- updates a second against a game drawing sixty -- and the owner read the result
-- exactly right: the tag TELEPORTS. Every other tag is an entity anchor the host
-- projects on every frame, so the local one was the only thing on screen moving in
-- steps, beside four that were not.
--
-- `SetTick` is the host's own per-frame task: an implicit `Wait(0)` loop under the
-- same per-frame budget as any other. The body is one engine read and one patch,
-- for at most ONE anchor, and it returns immediately when no own tag is up -- so
-- the frames where this costs anything are the frames where it is being looked at.
