--- Staff name tags: who is nearby, what they are called, and where the tag sits.
-- @author dop42
--
-- The ACCOUNT list is the one thing a client cannot work out for itself, and the
-- server sends it only to a player the ACL grants `opx.admin.self.tags`. Nothing
-- here asks for it: it arrives, and it stops arriving the moment the grant does.
--
-- THE CHARACTER IS NOT ON THAT LIST, and deliberately not. Who somebody is
-- PLAYING is on their replicated state bag, which this client already holds for
-- everybody in its bucket -- so it is read here rather than sent, and a tag costs
-- the wire nothing it was not already costing. `character`'s own contract is the
-- reader (`GetPlayerIdentity`); this file never touches `Open77.state` itself.
--
-- A tag therefore carries three names and each has a different provenance:
--   `name`       the CHARACTER, off the bag -- what the city calls them
--   `user`       the ACCOUNT, off the staff list -- what a ban is keyed on
--   `citizenId`  the character's public id, off the bag -- what survives both
-- With no character loaded the account moves into `name` and `user` goes empty:
-- a tag over a body has to say something, and the account is what there is.
--
-- The pass is registered with `OPX.Scheduler` and never spawned as a loop of its
-- own: exceeding the per-resume instruction budget unwinds out of a coroutine
-- body and a `while true ... Wait(n)` loop that hits it is never resumed again,
-- silently. It returns at once while the tags are off.

-- module attaches by listening to it with a bare `AddEventHandler`.
--
-- A view for this belongs on the OVERLAY surface (`OPX.UI.Send('overlay', ...)`)
-- and must never take focus: a name tag that captured the keyboard would stop the
-- player moving. It draws each row against a world anchor -- `Open77.anchors`,
-- with the overlay surface as the anchor's page -- and nothing else.
--
-- Three kinds go out:
--   'config'  once, and again on every switch-on: the colours, whether the id
--             square is drawn, and the word a staff badge carries
--   'rows'    the tags to draw now: one row per player, with the entity to

	-- unreadable store and the unset key land on the same line the way they
	-- always meant to. The hand-rolled version did not quite manage that: an
