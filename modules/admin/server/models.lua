--- Wearing an NPC body: the ped a player is projected as, and giving it back.
-- @author dop42
--
-- The record is never typed through: an operator names a ROW in
-- `data/peds.lua` and this file hands the host that row's record. A raw
-- `Character.*` string is accepted too, but only when it is a row's record --
-- the allowlist is the point, and the platform would otherwise take any of the
-- 6,582 extracted ids, most of which are quest bodies that do not animate on a
-- player.
--
-- THE BUILD MAY NOT HAVE THIS AT ALL. `Open77.players.setModel` and its aliases
-- arrived after 2.31.13+op77.76, which is the newest build the devkit catalogue
-- knows; the server this was written against runs op77.75. So every call goes
-- through `api()`, which answers nil when the native is absent, and the command
-- then refuses with `models_unavailable` instead of raising. The menu rows stay
-- drawn: the ACL grants them, the catalogue is real, and the day the server is
-- upgraded they start working with no change here.
--
-- A ped is not a placement and not a respawn: the body stays where it stands.
-- The readiness gate is still checked, because a model written on a client that
-- is not incarnated is the same class of mistake a transform write would be.
