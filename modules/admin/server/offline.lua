--- The staff door onto the characters of people who are NOT HERE.
-- @author dop42
--
-- WHAT "OFFLINE" TURNS OUT TO MEAN, because the schema decides it and not the
-- menu. There is no column that says a character is offline. `last_logged_out`
-- is the last time one STOPPED being played and is just as stale for a character
-- somebody is holding right now; `opx77_active_characters` says which character
-- an account ENTERS on, whether or not that account has a session. So the only
-- persisted thing to list is the character row, and whether anybody is holding
-- it is a fact about this process, in memory, for the handful of slots that are
-- occupied.
--
-- SO THIS LISTS CHARACTERS AND TAGS THE ONES THAT ARE NOT OFFLINE, rather than
-- filtering them out, and the honesty is the point:
--
--   * a WHERE clause on who is connected is stale before the payload lands. An
--     operator reading a list built a tick ago is reading the past either way;
--     the difference is that a filtered list hides the row and a tagged one says
--     `playing` next to it.
--   * removing rows after the SQL breaks the count without breaking the seek. It
--     is survivable -- the cursor is the last row the DATABASE answered, not the
--     last one shown -- but a page of 25 that draws 22, with no way to say which
--     three went or why, reads as a list with holes in it.
--   * a small server where everybody is on would answer nothing but empty pages
--     while staff paged through them looking for somebody who was right there.
--
-- Two tags, and they are different questions. `live` is a session holding THAT
-- citizen id. `online` is a session on that ACCOUNT -- the person is here,
-- playing one of their others -- and that one is reachable the short way, under
-- `Players > them > Characters`.
--
-- NO SQL AND NO CHARACTER DATA LIVES HERE, the same standing rule the rest of
-- this module keeps: the query belongs to `character/server/storage.lua` and the
-- decision to `character`, and this file is one call into the contract plus the
-- two things only the staff module knows -- who is connected, and who is allowed
-- to ask.
