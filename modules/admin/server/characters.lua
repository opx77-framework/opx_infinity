--- The staff door onto an account's CHARACTERS: read them, rename one, delete one.
-- @author dop42
--
-- WHAT THIS IS NOT. `opx.admin.player.*` is the session and the puppet -- freeze
-- it, heal it, move it, kill it -- and every one of those dies with the
-- connection. This file reaches the ROWS behind that connection, which outlive
-- it: a character an operator renames or deletes here is one the player will
-- still own tomorrow, or will not. That is why the three commands are their own
-- ACL namespace rather than more `player.*` grants -- an operator trusted to
-- unfreeze somebody is not automatically trusted to delete what they have played
-- for a month.
--
-- NO CHARACTER DATA LIVES HERE, which is this module's standing rule. What a
-- character IS belongs to `character`, and all three commands are one call into
-- its contract: `ListCharactersFor`, `RenameCharacter`, `RemoveCharacter`. Those
-- three exist beside the self-service ones (`ListCharacters`, `SetName`,
-- `DeleteCharacter`) and deliberately do NOT check ownership, because the check
-- is the access list and it has already happened -- `Server.Command` registers
-- every one of these as restricted and the host refuses the line before a
-- handler ever runs. Read from the SERVER, never from a client: a contract call
-- made on a client is no permission check at all.
--
-- EVERY READER HERE YIELDS. An account's characters come out of the database and
-- a rename writes back to it, so each handler answers everything it can answer
-- without a thread first and hands the rest to a `CreateThread`.
--
-- WHY THERE IS NO "EDIT EVERYTHING" FORM. The editable identity of a character
-- is its name. The other things staff reach for are already commands that belong
-- to the modules that own them -- job, gang and money are `LINKS` on the
-- character screen -- and the rest of the row is a RECORD rather than a setting:
-- `created_at` and `last_logged_out` are what happened, and a date this module
-- could rewrite is an audit trail that cannot be trusted. There is no birth date
-- to edit; lifepath, origin and date of birth were dropped from the schema.
