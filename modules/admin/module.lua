--- The staff tool: find a player, get to them, fix them, move them, arm them,
--- hand them a car, or remove them from the server.
-- @author dop42
--
-- THIS MODULE ADDS NO AUTHORITY OF ITS OWN. Every staff action is a restricted
-- command, and the host resolves `command.<name>` against `acl.jsonc` BEFORE the
-- handler runs. Nothing here checks a permission and nothing here should: the
-- host has already decided, and a second check would only diverge from it. The
-- menu, the eye and the forms are HINTS -- they grey out what the ACL would
-- refuse, and the server re-derives everything when the command arrives. A
-- client that drew a row it should not have still gets refused by the host.
--
-- `OPX.Command.Register(name, { restricted = true }, handler)` is the only door.
-- It owns the ACL flag and the suggestion list, and it only offers a restricted
-- command to a player the ACL would let run it.
--
-- WHAT IT OWNS AND WHAT IT DOES NOT. No character data: what a character IS
-- belongs to `character`, what it CARRIES to `inventory`, the sky to `weather`.
-- The menu drives their commands by name through `LINKS` rather than calling
-- their contracts, because a contract call from a client is no permission check.
-- Nothing is written to the database, so there is no `server/storage.lua`.
--
-- Every contract but `character` is optional and each is asked for with
-- `OPX.Api.Get`. An answer of nil costs one logged line and one feature; the
-- commands keep working from the chat box and the console either way. That is
-- the whole point of a staff tool: it must not refuse to start because the menu
-- is missing at the moment somebody has to be removed from the server.
--
-- ONE THING THE CONTRACTS CANNOT SAY. `inventory`'s item view carries
-- `weapon = true` and `ammo = true` and nothing else -- not a weapon's class, not
-- the ammunition item it loads, not an ammunition item's full load. So the
-- weapon screens list weapons in one paged list rather than by class, and
-- ammunition is named by its own item rather than inferred from a weapon. Adding
-- `class`, `ammoName` and `ammoMax` to `Catalog.ViewOf` would restore both.

	-- `downed` keeps the menu usable while the operator is on the floor; `prompts`
	-- draws the travel strip.
	-- `diagnostics` is the odd one out: it carries no feature, it carries the
	-- relay that puts a client-side fault in the SERVER journal, which is the
