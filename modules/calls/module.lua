--- Holocalls: player to player, the call owned by the server.
-- @author dop42
--
-- The owner calls it "appel vision". It is Cyberpunk's own holocall, wired
-- between two -- or three -- connected players instead of between V and a quest
-- NPC: somebody places a call, the other party's screen shows a small curved
-- card at the EDGE of the view, and they answer or refuse it on the target eye
-- rather than on a key of its own. While the call runs both parties' eyes carry
-- the game's authored blue glow.
--
-- THE CALL IS A SERVER OBJECT AND THE CLIENT DECIDES NOTHING. That is not a
-- style rule here, it is what makes the feature possible at all: two machines
-- are involved and neither may be believed about what the other agreed to. A
-- client says "I pressed accept" and the server says who is in the call, who
-- may be added, whose eyes are lit and when the whole thing ends. Every screen
-- in this module is drawn from a state the server pushed.
--
-- THREE THINGS NEED CONSENT AND THERE IS ONE MECHANISM FOR ALL THREE. Placing a
-- call, adding a third participant and handing over a contact are the same
-- shape -- somebody asks, somebody else agrees or does not -- so they are one
-- object, an INVITE with a `kind`, and one accept/decline pair. The first
-- sketch had three verb families and three refusal vocabularies; they disagreed
-- about the cooldown within an hour of being written.
--
--   invite(kind = call)     nobody is in a call yet; accepting creates one
--   invite(kind = join)     the sender is in a call; accepting adds the target
--   invite(kind = contact)  no call at all; accepting swaps contact rows
--
-- ONE CALL AT A TIME, ONE INVITE OUT, ONE INVITE IN. A player is in at most one
-- call, has at most one invite outstanding and at most one waiting for an
-- answer. The last of the three is the one that is really a UI decision made
-- honest: the incoming card shows ONE call, so a second would have to be
-- queued, stacked or dropped -- and a queue of calls somebody never sees is
-- worse than a refusal the caller reads immediately.
--
-- The decisions themselves are in `shared/model.lua`, which touches no host at
-- all: the server hands it predicates and reads its verdicts. That is the split
-- `modules/target/shared/model.lua` uses and it is here for the same reason --
-- the rules are the half worth testing, and they are testable without a game.
