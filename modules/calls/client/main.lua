--- The client half: the state the server pushed, the rows on the eye, the ring.
-- @author dop42
--
-- This file owns a state machine and DRAWS NOTHING. It says everything it has
-- to say on the local `calls:view` event and takes everything back through
-- `M.FromView`; `client/view.lua` is the only file that knows those two ends
-- are a CEF page. That is the seam `modules/downed` uses and it is here for the
-- same reason -- the state half stays testable without a browser.
--
-- NOTHING IN THIS FILE IS A FACT. The server pushes one payload describing this
-- player's whole call world and everything below is a projection of it. A key
-- does not end a call, it asks the server to. The only local state is about
-- this machine's speakers and this screen -- which ring was silenced, which
-- dial tone was stopped, whether the hologram is open -- and the server
-- neither knows nor should.
--
-- ONE SCREEN. The incoming card and the live chip that used to sit at the edge
-- of the view are gone, and with them the card's dwell clock and its
-- dismiss/re-pop pair: the sphere in `HoloRoot.vue` pops on a call arriving,
-- says who it is and which key answers, and takes nothing. So the only payload
-- this file publishes is the hologram's (`kind = 'holo'`).
--
-- ── the rows, and the budget ─────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Seven rows across two kinds. `RegisterMany` is ALL OR NOTHING -- one
-- malformed row refuses the whole batch and the refusal is written to a log on
-- the player's own machine -- which is the trap `modules/animations/client/walk.lua`
-- fell into and documented, so the registration is one `Register*` call per
-- kind with a `Wait(0)` between, on a thread of its own, and the answer of each
-- is checked and relayed with `OPX.Note` rather than `Open77.log`.
--
-- THE ROWS ARE REGISTERED ONCE AND NEVER RE-REGISTERED. `canInteract` is what
-- makes a row appear and disappear: answer is called in-process on every pick,
-- costs a table lookup, and reads the same state the screen does. The first
-- sketch re-registered the set on every state push -- a `Clear` plus two
-- `Register*` calls per incoming call -- which is the admin module's whole
-- instruction-budget story being re-enacted on a hot path.
--
-- ── the sound ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- `Open77.sfx.play2d(event)` plays one of Cyberpunk's own `ui_phone_01` Wwise
-- events, by name, with nothing shipped and nothing copied -- see the SOUND
-- block in `config/calls.lua`. It is gated on `world.effects`, which this
-- manifest already declares for the vfx the staff noclip pops, and its refusal
-- is SILENT in the same way: the native answers `nil, permission_denied` or
-- `nil, invalid_sfx_event` and logs nothing. So every call goes through `ring`
-- below, which notes the FIRST refusal of each event name to the server and
-- then stops asking about it.

-- refuses -- `tooFast` included -- goes back with this player's state, so a

--
-- THE OWNER: "petit bug quand il repond a l'appel on s'entend pas". The server

-- `modules/calls/server/main.lua` -- and membership is what makes the other
-- person AUDIBLE. It is not what makes you audible to them.
--
-- A client captures one stream and ROUTES it: `setTransmitting`'s intent picks
-- between proximity, the channels you are a member of, or both. The default is
-- proximity, which across Night City reaches nobody, so two people on a call
-- could each hear a channel neither of them was speaking into.
--
-- THE MIC IS NEVER FORCED OPEN, and the shape below is the whole of that
-- promise: `enabled` is read back out of `Open77.voice.status()` and handed
-- straight back. This says "whatever you are doing with the microphone, keep
-- doing it, and send it to the call as well" -- it cannot start a transmission
-- and it cannot stop one. `all` rather than `channels` because a holocall in a
-- shared world should still be half-audible to whoever is standing next to you.
--
-- Re-asserted on the sweep as well as on the state change, because `open-voice`

-- empty forever -- and this row makes it redundant. One way to do a thing.
