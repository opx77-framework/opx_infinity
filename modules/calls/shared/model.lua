--- The call object and every rule about it, with no host call of its own.
-- @author dop42
--
-- Deliberately pure, for the reason `modules/target/shared/model.lua` gives at
-- its head: every question that needs the host -- is this player through the
-- gate, are these two bodies within arm's reach, what time is it -- is asked by
-- the caller and handed in. That is what makes `judge`, `near` and `now`
-- parameters of `Model.New` rather than calls from inside the verbs here.
--
-- It is also what makes the rules TESTABLE. A holocall needs two connected
-- machines, a readiness gate, a life state and an eye-glow lease to exercise
-- for real; it needs none of those to answer "may a player who is already in a
-- call place a second one". The second question is the one that has an
-- interesting answer, so it lives where a test can reach it.
--
-- ── the object ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
--   call    { id, startedAtMs, founder, order = { playerId... } }
--   invite  { id, kind, from, to, callId, atMs, expiresAtMs }
--
-- `order` is a LIST and not a set, and that is a display decision made once:
-- the founder is first and everybody else follows in the order they joined, so
-- the three participants of a call read the same way on all three screens. A
-- set would have been iterated by `pairs`, which orders by nothing.
--
-- ── one call, one invite out, one invite in ──────────────────────────────────
--
-- Three indexes hold the whole of that rule, and each is a single value rather
-- than a list, which is what makes it enforceable by assignment rather than by
-- counting:
--
--   callOf[playerId]    the call they are in, or nil
--   outgoing[playerId]  the invite they are waiting on an answer to, or nil
--   incoming[playerId]  the invite waiting for THEIR answer, or nil
--
-- The third is the one that is a screen decision made honest. The incoming card
-- shows ONE call. A second arriving while the first is up would have to be
-- queued, stacked or silently dropped, and a queue of calls a player never sees
-- is worse for the caller than a refusal they read at once.
--
-- ── the three kinds, and why they are one object ─────────────────────────────
--
-- Placing a call, adding a third and handing over a contact are the same shape:
-- somebody asks, somebody else agrees or does not, and until they agree nothing
-- has happened. Written as three verb families they were three cooldowns,
-- three expiry rules and three spellings of "that player is busy", and they
-- disagreed with each other within an hour of being written. One invite with a
-- `kind` is one accept path and one decline path.
--
-- ── the ids ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- Minted from a counter, so they are short, greppable in a journal, and the
-- same across a test run. NOT SECRET, and nothing rests on them being secret:
-- `Accept` and `Decline` check that the invite named IS the caller's own
-- `incoming` one, so a player who guesses somebody else's id learns nothing and
-- can do nothing with it. An id that carried authority would have to be
-- unguessable and this one carries none.

--- Every refusal this module can answer, as a CLOSED set.
---
--- IT IS A SET AND NOT A CONVENTION, and the reason is `OPX.RefusalKey`: a code
--- reaching a player is looked up in the locale catalogue, and one that is not
--- there is downgraded to `error.unavailable` with a warning nobody reads. So a
--- refusal invented at a call site is a refusal the player is never told. Every
--- name here has an `calls.error.<name>` entry in `locales.lua`, and the test
--- suite holds the two lists against each other.
---
--- The pairs that look redundant are not. `notReady` is about the player who
--- ASKED and `targetNotReady` about the player they asked for, and a caller who
--- cannot tell those apart is told "that did not work" for two situations with
--- two different remedies -- wait a moment, versus that person is not here.
--- `disabled` IS NOT IN IT, and its absence was a deliberate removal rather
--- than an oversight. It was written here first, for a module switched off in
--- the config -- and nothing can ever answer it: `OPX.Modules.Declare` reads
--- `enabled == false` and the module never reaches a phase, so there is no
--- handler to refuse with it and no contract to refuse through. A name in a
--- closed set that nothing can answer is a refusal the next author will reach
--- for and a sentence in two catalogues nobody will ever read.
