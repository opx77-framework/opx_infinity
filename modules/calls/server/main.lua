--- Server authority over a holocall: who is on it, who may join, and whose
--- eyes are lit.
-- @author dop42
--
-- The rules are in `shared/model.lua` and touch no host. THIS file is the half
-- that does: it asks the platform whether a player is through the gate, whether
-- they are alive, where they are standing and what they are called, hands those
-- answers to the model as predicates, and turns the model's verdicts into wire
-- traffic and into an eye-glow lease.
--
-- The split is worth stating once because it is what every function below
-- obeys. NOTHING HERE DECIDES ANYTHING. `onInvite` reads a player id off the
-- wire, bounds it, checks a cooldown, and asks the model; if the model says no,
-- the refusal is relayed and the function is over. There is no branch in this
-- file that opens a call, and there is no branch in the model that sends one.
--
-- ── the blue eyes ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- `Open77.players.setHoloCallEyes(playerId, enabled, { durationMs })` is the
-- platform's own holocall glow -- the game's authored effect, not a light this
-- resource invented -- and it is a LEASE held by a resource VM rather than a
-- switch on a player. The platform's own words: the glow stays on while ANY
-- resource holds a lease, `false` releases only ours, and it clears by itself
-- on death, disconnect, resource stop and expiry.
--
-- TAKEN WITH A DEADLINE AND RENEWED, never held open, and that decision is
-- borrowed wholesale from `modules/animations/client/walk.lua`, whose header
-- says why at length: a lease is not tied to the thing that justified it, so a
-- call that ends down a path nobody released on leaves a player glowing for
-- the rest of their session with nothing on screen explaining it. With a
-- bounded lease the worst case is EYES.LEASE_MS of glow. The sweep renews
-- every participant's lease, which is what makes a live call keep it.
--
-- AND IT IS READ BACK. `Open77.players.getHoloCallEyes` answers whether any
-- resource holds a lease, so it cannot tell us whether OURS survived -- but it
-- can tell us that NOBODY'S did, and for a participant we believe we are
-- holding one for, that is a lease the platform dropped: a death, a reload, an
-- expiry we mis-timed. The sweep re-acquires it and says so once. That is the
-- same watchdog shape `Walk.Check` has, and it exists for the same reason --
-- the release path is a promise about every exit, and a promise about every
-- exit is the kind that is kept until somebody adds an exit.

-- ── the voice channel ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
--
-- THE OWNER: "petit bug quand il repond a l'appel on s'entend pas". Not a bug in
-- what was built -- this half was never built at all, and it was reported as a
-- limitation when the feature landed: the call carried its STATE and its
-- PRESENTATION, and no audio. Two players on a call heard each other exactly as
-- far as ordinary proximity carried, which across the city is not at all.
--
-- A call gets a channel of its own, created on demand and destroyed with the
-- call. The same discipline as the eye-glow above and for the same reason: this
-- is world state the platform holds on our word, and a call that ends down an
-- unreleased path would leave two strangers able to hear each other for the rest
-- of the session. `channelOf` is keyed by call id, `dropChannel` is safe to call
-- for a call that never had one, and the sweep gives back what the wire missed.
--
-- LISTENING IS OURS TO GRANT; SPEAKING IS NOT, ENTIRELY. Membership with
-- `canListen` is what makes the other half audible, and the server owns it. What
-- the server cannot own is which route a speaker's frame takes: the client picks
-- that with `setTransmitting`'s intent, and by default that is proximity. The
-- client half asserts `all` while a call is live -- see `modules/calls/client`
-- -- so the player is heard both by the call and by anyone standing next to
-- them, which is what a phone call in a shared world should sound like.
