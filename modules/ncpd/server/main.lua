--- The server half: the book is journalled, crimes are charged, the city answers.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- THE ONE PATH FROM A CRIME TO A WANTED PLAYER. `charge` is the only function
-- that writes the ledger, and `publish` the only one that tells a client and
-- stands a response up. Everything else -- the commands, the contract other
-- resources call, the decay pass -- goes through those two, so there is exactly
-- one place where a stage changes and exactly one place where the street reacts
-- to it. A second door would be two answers to "why are there police here".
--
-- THE LEDGER IS THE AUTHORITY AND THE ENGINE IS THE ACTOR. Nothing here writes a
-- wanted level fact or draws a star: the client is told the stage and asks the
-- engine's own scripted `PreventionSystem` for it, which is what makes the wanted
-- bar, the siren audio, the police radio and the stage's own effects real. A
-- client that cannot do that says so in its log and the ledger still holds the
-- score -- the city knows, the client cannot show it.
--
-- THE BOOK IS VALIDATED ELSEWHERE AND JOURNALLED HERE. `shared/law.lua` names
-- every value the config could not use; those warnings are worthless unless
-- somebody says them out loud, so `M.Start` prints them and then the book it did
-- accept, as one line an operator can read after editing a config.

-- ── the engine's own heat, mirrored ───────────────────────────────────────────

--- Mirrors the stage one client's own engine is holding into the ledger.
--
-- WHY THIS IS THE CRIME PATH AND NOT A SHORTCUT. The engine scores its own crimes
-- -- a kill, a theft, a car through a crowd -- and nothing native can read that
-- score: `PreventionSystem`'s 287 methods are all scripted. So the ledger cannot
-- charge a crime it cannot see, and the one place a real crime is visible at all is
-- the client that committed it. That client reads its own engine and states the
-- stage; this function applies it, stands the response up and lets the log name it.
--
-- THE STAGE IS COPIED, NEVER SCORED. Charging the book for a reported stage would
-- be a second scorer: the engine would climb, we would charge a law, our stage would
-- cross higher than the engine's, the client would be told to climb, and it would
-- report that back -- each loop a stage. `Set` is the only write here, so the ledger
-- follows the engine and can never amplify it.
--
-- ATTRIBUTED BY CONNECTION. The payload is one stage and nothing else; the citizen
-- is resolved from the connection the report arrived on, so the worst a modified
-- client can do is lie about its OWN heat -- which the engine on its own client
-- would immediately contradict, one report later.
-- @param stage any the stage the engine mirror last read
local function onEngineStage(stage)
