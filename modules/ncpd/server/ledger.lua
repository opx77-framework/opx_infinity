--- The crime ledger: who the city is looking for, and how hard.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- ONE LEDGER PER CHARACTER, NOT PER CONNECTION. A ledger bound to a connection
-- would forget a wanted player the moment they dropped, and a wanted player
-- leaving and rejoining is the ordinary way out of a police chase -- so the key
-- is the citizen id the `character` contract hands out, and a reconnect rejoins
-- the city's memory of them.
--
-- A SCORE THAT CLIMBS ONE STAGE AT A TIME, IN THE ENGINE'S OWN SHAPE.
-- `shared/law.lua` owns what a crime costs and how the ladder is crossed; this
-- file owns only when each of those is asked, and remembers the answer. The
-- crossing rule is deliberately not "enough score to reach stage N": the engine
-- checks its threshold once per crime and ZEROES the score as it crosses
-- (`preventionSystem.script:2501`), so one enormous score buys one stage and
-- starts again from zero. `Law.Advance` is written to that shape and this file
-- never re-derives it.
--
-- THE STAGE FALLS BY TIME, NOT BY SCORE, AND THAT IS NOT A DETAIL. Every
-- crossing resets the score to zero on purpose, so "the score is zero" is the
-- state a player is in immediately after being promoted -- reading it as "no
-- longer wanted" would clear the stage this ledger just raised, on the same
-- call. The drop is therefore `DECAY.RESET_SECONDS` of nothing at all, which is
-- the module's own version of the engine's `HeatCrimeScoreResetTime`.
--
-- NOTHING IS PERSISTED YET, AND THAT IS SAID OUT LOUD. There is no table for
-- this module: a restart clears the city's memory of a crime. A player who
-- rejoins a restarted server is a free citizen, which is the same lie the
-- platform already tells about props, and it is the honest default until a
-- storage contract is chosen rather than an accident of a missing write.
