--- The client half: one stage from the server becomes this client's own heat.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- WHY THE CLIENT DOES THIS AND NOT THE SERVER. `PreventionSystem`'s 287 methods
-- are all scripted -- not one is native -- and the ones that raise a stage are
-- private, so nothing outside the game's script frame can move a star. `open77-base`
-- therefore carries a narrow seam: `Open77.prevention.heat(playerId, stage)` and
-- `.av(playerId)` queue the request into the REDscript bridge, which executes it
-- inside the script frame the client owns, on the LOCAL player only. The address
-- is the safety property -- a command naming a player this client is not is
-- refused by the bridge and counted -- so this file passes the id the server
-- named and never substitutes its own.
--
-- THE ENGINE OWNS EVERYTHING VISIBLE. The wanted bar, the stars, the siren audio
-- stake, the police radio and the per-stage effects all happen inside the game's
-- own `OnHeatChanged`, which is why there is no HUD drawn here: drawing a second
-- wanted bar over the engine's would be two answers to "how wanted am I".
--
-- A CLIENT WITHOUT THE SEAM SAYS SO ONCE. The seam arrived after the build that
-- shipped it, so an older plugin answers `nil` for `Open77.prevention`. That is a
-- warning once and a named refusal per request, never a silent nothing: the
-- server's ledger still holds the score, and the one line in the log says which
-- half is missing.

-- `requestAv()` asks the engine's spawn system for the MaxTac AV, and `state()`
-- reports what was asked and what the script loop answered. There is no player
-- argument on any of them, because the engine's wanted level is scalar on a
-- singleton system and the spawn system holds one player handle -- the world
-- this client is simulating is the only world there is to move. The player id in
-- the payload below is therefore the server's bookkeeping and this module's own

-- is that read: it names no player, so a client reports what it is holding and
-- nothing else, and the server attributes the report to the connection it arrived
-- on rather than to anything the payload claims.
--
-- THE STAGE, NOT THE SCORE. The engine zeroes its score as it crosses a stage, so

-- answers to "how wanted am I", the newer one wrong. The stage is what the player
