--- NCPD and MaxTac: one law book, one heat ladder, two divisions.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- THE WANTED LEVEL IS A CRIME SCORE THE ENGINE RAISES ITSELF. `PreventionSystem`
-- keeps `m_totalCrimeScore` and raises `m_heatStage` (`Heat_0 .. Heat_5`) when
-- the score reaches the current stage's capacity, zeroing it as it crosses. The
-- `wanted_level` quest fact is written FROM that stage and read only by a debug
-- overlay, so a feature that sets the fact moves the bar and nothing else. This
-- module therefore owns the SCORE -- what a crime is worth, who is charged, how
-- fast it drains -- and drives the engine's own ladder so the sirens, the radio,
-- the roadblocks, the wanted bar and the response units are the game's.
--
-- THE TWO DIVISIONS ARE THE ENGINE'S OWN SPLIT, not a taxonomy we invented:
-- `Heat_1 .. Heat_4` is the NCPD ladder (Cortes, Archer Hella, Emperor,
-- Merrimac, the Hellhound at `Heat_5`), and MaxTac is the separate division that
-- arrives at `Heat_5` in a Zetatech Surveyor with its own agent registry, its
-- own tag (`MaxTac_NotPrevention`), its own status effect and its own insertion
-- run. `config/ncpd.lua` names every record; nothing in this module spells one
-- as a literal.
--
-- TROOPERS ARE PLAYERS FIRST AND BOTS SECOND. A MaxTac summon fills the squad
-- from players who opted into the division and any seat still empty at the
-- response deadline is filled with the engine's own trooper records, so an empty
-- division never means an empty street. `FILL = 'bots'` in config is what makes
-- that the default, and `'players'` makes the job player-only on purpose.
--
-- THE LEVER IS A PLATFORM SEAM. `PreventionSystem`'s 287 methods are all
-- scripted, so nothing native can raise a stage: the client enqueues a command
-- string and its REDscript loop executes it inside the script frame it owns, on
-- the local player only. `open77-base` now carries the two this feature needs --
-- `prevention.heat:<0-5>` and `prevention.av`, each addressed to the player it
-- was asked for and refused when that player is not the client running it -- and
-- the client reads the effect back with `prevention.state`.
--
-- A CRIME COMMITTED IN THE WORLD ARRIVES AS THE CLIENT'S OWN READING. The engine
-- scores its own crimes and publishes nothing, so the client reads its own
-- `PreventionSystem` through `Open77.prevention.state()` and reports the stage it
-- holds; the server mirrors that into the ledger and stands the response up. The
-- law book is therefore the server's own instrument -- for jobs, for the operator
-- commands, for anything a script wants charged -- rather than the only way a
-- player becomes wanted.
--
-- `character` is optional here and not required: the ledger binds heat to a
-- loaded character, and without that contract it has nobody to charge, which is
-- a refusal with a line rather than a module that takes the whole resource down.
-- `vehicles`, `hud` and `prompts` are optional for the same reason: without them
-- the law book still loads and still scores, and only the surfaces are missing.

	-- Client to server. A body is at the crew door of the MaxTac aircraft and
	-- wants in. IT CARRIES NOTHING, deliberately: the server resolves the player
	-- from the connection it arrived on, the hull from its own runs, and the

	-- nothing else. It cannot name a seat, an aircraft, or a place.

	-- Server to client, to one seated crew member alone: the exit lock is off.
	-- Said because the lock coming off is the one moment a body in a flying hull

	-- bug rather than a landing.

	-- Client to server, the police scanner: open it or stow it. It carries one

--- The police scanner: its bands, its key, and every refusal it can read.
--
-- CHANNELS ARE VOCABULARY; AUDIENCE IS THE SERVER'S. The four bands exist for
-- everybody who may open a scanner -- one piece of hardware with two knobs --
-- but only the server decides who HEARS a band, and it says so per band in the
-- frame (`hear`), so a band this listener cannot hear is drawn as a dark band
-- rather than looking like a quiet one. `server/radio.lua` is the only reader of
-- the rule; nothing here says which job hears what.
--
-- EVERY BAND IS ALSO A VOICE CHANNEL. Talking is the platform's own VOIP
-- (`wiki/voice.md`): one Opus stream routed through up to four channels at
-- once, with a radio effect the host renders itself -- so the PTT keys a real
-- transmission and the volume knob turns a real gain, and no audio payload
-- ever passes through Lua. `server/radio.lua` owns the channels (it owns the
-- audience rule already) and carries each band's voice id in the frame;
-- `VOICE_EFFECT` is the band's declared sound.
--
-- FREQUENCIES ARE CONTENT (rule 8 of the UI contract): the micro-label on a
-- channel row states the band's own declared frequency -- something the surface
-- knows -- rather than invented chrome.
-- The client seam's home: `client/radioview.lua` fills this in with the
-- wiring between the state half and the CEF page. Created here -- beside
-- `M.Radio` -- so the seam file never has to index a table that does not
-- exist yet (the namespace is owned in one place).
