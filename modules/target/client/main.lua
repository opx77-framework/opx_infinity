--- The eye: the held key, the screen ray under the cursor, the row list and the pick.
-- @author dop42
--
-- WHERE THE WORK IS BOUNDED, because this is the module that proved it matters.
--
-- Holding the key and pressing the RIGHT button asks every row that matches what
-- the ray hit whether it applies. A row whose owner is another resource answers
-- over a host call, and the original did all of them inside one coroutine body.
-- That body exceeded the per-resume instruction budget, which unwinds straight out
-- of the coroutine and never resumes it -- no crash, no repeat, nothing logged.
-- Three things keep that from coming back and none of them is optional:
--
--   1. a pick is resolved in SLICES of `BATCH` rows, one slice per scheduler pass,
--      each on its own one-shot thread that ends when the slice does;
--   2. an owner's liveness is cached for `ALIVE_CACHE_MS` and the registry sweeps
--      ONCE per batch, not once per row;
--   3. `MAX_PER_OWNER` bounds how much any one owner can add to the walk.
--
-- The scheduler is the other half of it: there is no `CreateThread` loop here at
-- all. `OPX.Scheduler.Every` runs the repeating jobs, and the only threads this
-- file spawns are one-shot bodies for work that has to yield on a promise.
--
-- TWO of those jobs stand for the session -- `target:sweep` and `target:watch` --
-- and the third, `target:resolve`, exists only while a pick is in flight. The
-- slicing above is what makes it the fastest job in the resource, and a job at
-- that interval sets the floor on how often the one client loop wakes; leaving it
-- registered between picks bought forty passes a second of reading a nil. See
-- `setPending`.

		-- aim. `position` is only the ray endpoint at `maxDistance`."
		--
		-- The belief came from reading a card that enumerated what a hit ADDS
		-- and concluding the base fields were absent. They were never absent.

		-- The derivation was also wrong in a way that mattered: it measured from

		-- rotation, NOT walking. So a player taking one step while the list was
