--- The character's face, the clothes it wears, the looks other players are sent,
--- and the one announcement that lets anybody into the world.
-- @author dop42
--
-- FATAL, and not for the usual reason. Every joining player carries a hold named
-- `__platform` on the readiness gate that no Lua may take or release and that has
-- no deadline. It clears on exactly one thing: a client announcing
-- `open77:session:gameplayReady`. This module is what sends it. Without it the
-- loading cover never lifts, no world loads, no gate ever opens and nobody sees
-- anybody else's body. It also spends the one-shot character bootstrap at join,
-- which is what decides the body the world loads with.
--
-- Two ideas run through the whole module.
--
-- 1. A FACE IS NOT A MESH. A snapshot is a list of positions in the engine's
--    customization catalogue -- for each option, which index the player chose --
--    so it only means anything against the catalogue it was captured on. A face
--    from another game build is refused, never applied: applying it would put a
--    different face on the puppet rather than failing.
-- 2. A FUNCTION THAT YIELDS MUST BE ABLE TO GIVE UP. Every restore, every editor
--    and every publication carries a generation token, and a thread holding an
--    older one stops instead of finishing work for a character that has gone.
--
-- The body family is NOT chosen by a form. The engine's own character creator
-- asks for it and builds the face in the same flow, and what it answers is
-- written once to `charInfo.gender` on the character row; from then on this
-- module only reloads the world onto it. That is also why `gender` inside a
-- snapshot is something else entirely: the engine's opaque 64-bit body hash,
-- never the female/male string.

-- those places is three copies of a value with nothing keeping them in step, and
-- a typo in any one of them is a branch that is simply never taken.

-- at boot it is said once, in the block an operator scans after editing a config
