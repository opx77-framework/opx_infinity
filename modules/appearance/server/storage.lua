--- Every SQL statement this module runs, and the one table it owns.
-- @author dop42
--
-- This is the only file in the module allowed to carry SQL, and a CI check
-- enforces it. Nothing here decides anything: validation and ownership are the
-- caller's. Every statement yields and answers a `Result`, so every one of them
-- has to be reached from a `CreateThread`.
--
-- Statements bind named parameters (`@citizen`), never `?`: the bridge rewrites
-- `?` by walking the query text. No comment may appear inside a SQL string for
-- the same reason.
--
-- The face is NOT in this module's table. It is one nullable JSON column on the
-- character row, so that it travels with the character and disappears with it,
-- and so that a face survives exactly as long as the character it belongs to.
-- This module owns what goes in that column; the character module owns the row.

-- delete -- `deleted_at` is stamped and the row stays, so the slot is freed
-- without losing the history -- and no cascade fires for an UPDATE. So every
-- cascade in this schema is correct and none of them has ever run on a player
-- deleting a character.
--
-- The face is not here and needs nothing: it is a column on the character row
-- itself, so it goes when that row does.
