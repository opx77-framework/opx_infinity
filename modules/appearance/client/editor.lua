--- The two modal transactions: building a new character, and editing its face.
-- @author dop42
--
-- The engine's own screens are the only ones there are: an option is
-- `{ part, name, value, choices }` where `name` is an opaque 64-bit catalogue
-- hash with no human label anywhere on the platform. So this file does not draw
-- an editor, it opens one, and everything after the player confirms -- the
-- capture, the family, the save -- belongs here again.
--
-- THE TWO SCREENS ARE NOT THE SAME SCREEN.
--
-- * A CREATION opens the game's own character creator, which is the flow the
--   platform offers for it: the body choice first, then the whole face. It is
--   what decides the body family, and its answer -- `confirmed:female`,
--   `confirmed:male` or `cancelled` -- arrives in a mailbox that `Watch` reads
--   once. Nothing here asks the player which body to build on, and nothing here
--   reloads one to open it on.
-- * An EDIT opens the ripperdoc mirror on the body the character already has.
--   The mirror cannot change a body family, which is exactly why it is the
--   editor: the family belongs to the character row.
--
-- The mirror is also the fallback for a creation the creator refuses. A refused
-- creator must not be a player who cannot make a character, so the mirror is
-- opened on whatever body the world loaded and the family is read off it.
