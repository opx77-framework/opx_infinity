--- Puts the character's stored clothing on its puppet, and saves what changes.
-- @author dop42
--
-- The order is the whole design.
--   1. It WAITS FOR THE FACE. Nothing goes on before this world entry's face has
--      settled and gameplay-ready has gone out, never while a modal, a face commit
--      or a body reload is in the way, and never on a puppet a face could not go on
--      either. The announcement does NOT wait for clothing: the platform's own
--      presentation service answers that same announcement with its records.
--   2. It PUTS THE RECORD ON: every outfit replaced, the active one chosen, then
--      the nine slots stated.
--   3. It READS IT BACK, because the registry and the wardrobe have to show what
--      was put on before anything may be saved from them.
--   4. It SAVES CHANGES, and only ones that have held.
--
-- `PlayerData.clothing` is a record, `false` for 'none stored yet', or nil for
-- 'the server could not say'. Nil dresses nothing and saves nothing: writing now
-- would replace a record nobody was ever shown.
--
-- STEP 1's GATE IS BOUNDED, and that is not a detail. Everything below it is
-- reached only through a put-on, so a gate that never opens produces no attempt,
-- no read-back, no failure and no decision -- nothing happens and nothing says
-- so, on a client whose log the operator cannot read anyway. That silence held
-- the join-time fitting room open on a decision that could never arrive. `shut`
-- names the clause, and `stalled` reports it and then settles the world entry.

local M = OPX.Modules.Get('appearance')

local RESTORE_ATTEMPTS = 5
local VERIFY_MS = 2000

-- How long the gate of step 1 may be shut before the operator is told which
-- clause is holding it, and before this world entry gives up on dressing at all.
--
-- BOTH NUMBERS EXIST BECAUSE THE WAIT USED TO BE UNBOUNDED, and an unbounded
-- wait here is not just clothes that never go on. Nothing publishes
-- `clothingRestored` until a put-on has been read back, so a gate that never
-- opens is also a fitting room offer that never comes, a `Settled` that only
-- ever times out, and a `Report` of 'waiting' that nobody reads -- all of it
-- with no line anywhere, because a put-on that never happened cannot fail.
--
-- The report comes first and by a wide margin, because the ordinary case is a
-- gate shut for a second or two while the face settles and a native modal comes
-- down. The give-up is under `WARDROBE.CREATION_WAIT_MS` (60s shipped) on
-- purpose: the join asks for a fitting room and waits that long for one, and a
-- decision that arrived after the room had given up would be a decision nobody
-- was left to act on.
--
-- BOTH ARE COUNTED FROM THE GATE, NOT FROM THE JOIN. See `HELD`: the clock
-- restarts while a screen the player is standing in front of is up, so the two
-- numbers keep the same relation to `CREATION_WAIT_MS` -- both are measured from
-- the first moment the clothes could have gone on -- and neither is spent on a
-- creation, which is where they used to go.
local GATE_REPORT_MS = 12000
local GATE_GIVEUP_MS = 40000

-- The clauses of `shut` that are a SCREEN THE PLAYER IS STANDING IN FRONT OF,
-- and against which neither number above may be counted.
--
-- No value of GATE_GIVEUP_MS is right for these. A creation is human-paced and
-- has no deadline anywhere in this module on purpose -- `awaitWorld` says so in
-- as many words, "a player building a face for an hour is a correct state" --
-- so a fixed budget measured from the character arriving is a budget that
-- expires mid-creation and then reports the player's own deliberation as a
-- fault. Measured on 2026-09-20: creator up at 14:46:47, the face stored at
-- 14:47:57, and this gate gave up at 14:47:27 -- thirty seconds before the
-- creation it was waiting for had ended.
--
-- THE SAFETY NET IS NOT WEAKENED, IT IS AIMED. The forty seconds exist so a
-- character is not held undressed and unplaced for a session by a gate nothing
-- is doing anything about; a modal on screen is the opposite of that, and every
-- one of these clauses ends in something bounded elsewhere -- the creator by
-- `CREATOR_UNSEEN_MS`, a commit by its own deadline, an edit by the player
-- closing it. So the clock is RESTARTED while one of them holds, and the full
-- forty seconds are then available from the moment the screen comes down, which
-- is the first moment the clothes could have gone on at all.

--- WHY the puppet may not be dressed, or read for a save, now -- or nil.
-- @author dop42
--
-- This is the gate of step 1, and it is deliberately the strictest thing here.
-- It answers the NAME of the clause that is shut rather than a boolean, and that
-- is the whole difference between a fitting room that could not be diagnosed and
-- one that can: a shut gate produces no put-on, so it produces no read-back, so
-- it produces no `diagnose` line and no `clothingRestored` on the bus. The
-- symptom of every clause below is therefore identical and is *nothing at all* --
-- no clothes, no error, no journal line, and a join-time fitting room waiting on
-- a decision that is never reached. `Check` reports this name once the gate has
-- been shut long enough to be a fault rather than a moment.
--
-- THE CAUSES COME BEFORE THEIR CONSEQUENCES, and the order below is nothing but
-- that. `not_announced` and `appearance_unsettled` are both DOWNSTREAM of a
-- creation -- `AppearanceSettled` is false for as long as `creating` is true, by
-- design, and the announcement waits on `AppearanceSettled` -- so a creation
-- reported itself as `not_announced`, which is the symptom and names nothing a
-- reader can act on. Measured on 2026-09-20: forty seconds of `not_announced` on
-- ZXX-GAE6 that were forty seconds of a player standing in the character
-- creator, and two earlier diagnoses were argued from that word.
