-- THE PLATFORM GOES FIRST, AND THAT IS ITS ORDER, NOT OURS. On op77.121 a joining
-- player's puppet attaches with its pristine reset ARMED (`local player attached
-- ... reset=armed`) and the host runs that reset -- and only then places the body
-- and brings it alive -- AFTER `open77:session:gameplayReady`. Every join in the
-- owner's log of 2026-10-02 shows it: the announcement at 15:17:32.146, the reset
-- `clearing` 0.6 s later, `reset_complete` at .950, `life placement settled` at
-- 33.261. A restore that waits for a live body before letting the announcement
-- out is waiting for something only the announcement can start; the 5 s / 3 s
-- safety nets were all that broke it, and they gave the face up for the entry,
-- so every join landed on the default face.
--
-- So a restore waiting on the platform alone does not hold the gate: the
-- announcement goes out, the platform resets and revives the body, and the
-- restore -- still owning its token -- puts the face on that live body.
-- Everything else `AppearanceSettled` refuses still refuses here, and a reset
-- that has already run this entry means the platform is no longer the one
-- holding anything.

-- Both used to be cleared with the character, and `CHARACTERS.SWITCH = 'relog'`
-- swaps characters in the world, on the same puppet, with no world entry and no
-- reset to set them again. So the next character's face went on and its entry
-- never settled -- `AppearanceSettled` waits on a reset that was never coming --
-- and with it never announced: its clothes were never put on (`not_announced`),
-- nothing was saved, and the look was withdrawn at the unload and never
-- published again, so every other player stopped seeing them until they
-- reconnected. A real world entry (`WORLD_READY`, a body reload, a restart) goes
-- through `EnterWorld` and clears both, which is where they are owed.
