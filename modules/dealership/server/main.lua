--- Server half: the dealers, the showroom floor, the purchase and the sale.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- Everything the client believes is re-derived here before money moves: a
-- request is a hint, and the mask is these checks. The distance is measured
-- across the ground against the DECLARED position, exactly as the client
-- measures it, the bucket must agree, the model must be one THIS dealer sells,
-- and the money must really be there.
--
-- THE ORDER OF THE TWO WRITES IS NOT FREE. A purchase moves money and creates a
-- vehicle, and only one of those can be undone: the character contract can give
-- money back, and the vehicles contract creates a row and offers no way to
-- remove one. So the charge goes first and the registration second, and a
-- registration that is refused -- the ceiling, a refused insertion, a plate that
-- could not be drawn -- is answered with a refund of exactly what was taken. The
-- reverse order would hand out a free car every time a row could not be written.
--
-- This module owns no vehicle a player drives and no plate. What a character
-- owns, and every rule about how much of it they may own, stays in one place:
-- the vehicles contract. The one exception is the SHOWROOM, whose cars belong to
-- nobody, are created straight through `Open77.vehicles` with no row anywhere,
-- and are LOCKED -- an unlocked showroom car is a free car with an audience.
--
-- SELLING TO SOMEBODY STANDING IN FRONT OF YOU. Inside a dealer's zone the eye
-- grows a row on every other player, and a salesperson picks a model for them.
-- Nothing is charged by that press: an OFFER is recorded and the BUYER'S OWN
-- CLIENT confirms it, which is the owner's own choice over debiting an account
-- because somebody else clicked something. The price is paid into the COMPANY
-- BANK of the seller's job or gang and a configured percentage of it is paid to
-- the seller.
--
-- THE PLACEMENT COMMANDS ARE GONE. `/opx.dealership.add` and `.remove` wrote a
-- dealer into `opx77_dealerships`, so the shape of the world lived in a table
-- nobody had a copy of. A dealer is written in `config/dealership.lua` now, and
-- every row still in that table is ADOPTED at boot and printed as the line that
-- would check it in -- see "the legacy adoption".
--
-- Every value off the wire goes through `safe` before it reaches a format
-- string: a newline would forge a whole log line.
