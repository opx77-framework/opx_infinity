--- Client half: the markers, the strip row, the key, and the list you buy from.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- WHAT IS DRAWN HERE IS A HINT, and the list doubly so. The nearest dealer, the
-- radius, the stock and the price all decide only what this player is OFFERED;
-- the server re-derives the distance, the bucket, whether that dealer sells that
-- model and whether the money is there before anything is charged or created.
--
-- The dealers come from the server and never from `config/dealership.lua`
-- directly: captured dealers live in the database, and the server filters the
-- list to this player's own routing bucket. The prices come from the server for
-- the same reason -- it owns the currency table, and a client that formatted its
-- own would be a second answer to a question with one.
--
-- THE LIST IS THE `menu` MODULE'S, one flat screen at a time, with this file
-- holding its own stack -- the pattern the emote picker established. The whole
-- tree in one spec goes past the host's 1024-value bound, and a catalogue is
-- whatever an operator made it: two screens of forty rows each is a shop, and a
-- shop that silently stopped opening because the stock list grew is not.
--
-- The destination choice is read from the GARAGES contract, not resent by this
-- module: which garages exist, and where they are, is that module's answer, and
-- asking for a copy would be asking for a copy to keep in step.
--
-- The heading a capture records is read HERE and not on the server: a chat
-- command has no facing, and `Open77.character.yaw` is the only place a facing
-- exists. It is the one field this half contributes, and it only turns a
-- vehicle that is handed over where it was bought.
