--- Config reads, coercions and the decisions both halves share.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- Two vocabularies live here and they are deliberately separate things. A SPOT
-- is a place: where a dealer stands, which category it sells, and how it is
-- drawn. A STOCK ROW is a thing for sale: a name, a class, a TweakDB record and
-- a price. A purchase names one of each, and the server proves both again.
--
-- THE SPOT HALF IS NOT WRITTEN HERE. The record, the two input shapes that
-- normalise into it, the marker look and the coordinate box are all
-- `lib/shared/spots.lua`, and this file only names this module's own words to
-- them. `modules/garages/shared/access.lua` held 334 `diff`-clean identical
-- lines of it, and the two must agree exactly: a car bought at a dealer is
-- recalled at a garage, and a spot one of them accepts and the other refuses is
-- a car that exists nowhere.
--
-- THE STOCK HALF IS, and stays. What is for sale, at what price, and which kind
-- of dealer sells it is this module's own question -- no other module asks it --
-- and a shared catalogue would be a shape with one user.
--
-- Every value is coerced and never trusted: a coordinate that is a string, a
-- NaN, an unknown KIND or a price that is not a whole number above zero reads
-- as a warning at boot rather than a raise inside a scan, a menu or a purchase.
