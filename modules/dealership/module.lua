--- Dealerships: stand on a marker, pick a model, pay for it, choose the garage
--- it is delivered to.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- Three things have to agree before a player owns anything, and they are all
-- decided on the server: the dealer exists and the player is standing on it,
-- the model is one THIS dealer sells, and the money is really there. The client
-- draws the list and sends one request; everything it believes is a hint.
--
-- THE VEHICLE IS NOT CREATED HERE. This module owns no car and no plate: it
-- charges the character, then registers the row through the `vehicles` contract
-- -- which counts the ceiling, draws the plate and writes the row -- and hands
-- the buyer the key of the garage they chose, so what comes out of that marker
-- afterwards is what they just bought. `vehicles` remains the only owner of
-- what a character owns, and of the rules about how much they may own.
--
-- `garages` is optional and only answers one question: which garages may be
-- named as a destination. Without it every purchase is filed under the vehicles
-- module's own default garage, which is a working dealership with one fewer
-- choice, not a broken one.
--
-- `character` is required on both halves: on the server it is the money and the
-- ownership oracle, and on the client it is where the price is read back and
-- where a purchase is announced.
--
-- `prompts` and `menu` are optional too. Without `menu` there is no list to
-- click and `/opx.dealership.buy <key>` still sells a car; without `prompts`
-- the markers still draw and only the strip row is missing.
