--- Who actually holds a lock: the platform's door service, or every client.
-- @author dop42
--
-- TWO BACKENDS, ONE DECISION. Whatever turns a lock, `server/main.lua` has
-- already decided that it may turn; this file only knows how to make the world
-- agree.
--
-- NETWORKED. `open77_doors` keeps a server-owned registry of every world door
-- (devkit guide `doors`). A door registered by this resource is ours until the
-- resource stops, and its lock is one the platform's own authority enforces: a
-- locked door refuses every player's open request, and the client bridge
-- projects it onto the native door for everybody in the bucket. That is the
-- strong form, and the one an operator should run when they can.
--
-- LOCAL. Without the service there is no server-side door at all -- door state
-- is client-side -- so the server holds the state, `main.lua` broadcasts it, and
-- `client/main.lua` puts every streamed managed door into it with
-- `Open77.doors.setLocked` and `setInteractionAllowed`. It is what the test
-- server runs today: `open77_doors` depends on `open77_elevators`, and that
-- package would take the cabins away from the job-gated `elevators` module.
-- The lock is then each client's, which is a weaker promise -- a modified
-- client can open its own copy of a door -- and the README says so.
--
-- Every call into the service is an export through `Open77.exports.call`, so it
-- yields: everything here runs on a thread.
