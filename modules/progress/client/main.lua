--- The bar, the clock and the lock.
-- @author dop42
--
-- ONE BAR AT A TIME and one place that ends it. `finish` is the only function
-- that takes a bar down: it releases the lock, stops the gesture, tells the
-- page and answers the caller, in that order and on every path -- the clock
-- running out, a caller stopping it, the player going down, the character
-- leaving, the module stopping. A second exit written anywhere else is a lock
-- left on a player who can no longer move, which is the one failure this file
-- must not have.
--
-- THE LOCK IS A CLAIM, NOT A SWITCH, which is what makes it safe to hold.
-- `Open77.input.setActionBlocked` is owned by the calling resource: two
-- resources may block the same action, `false` removes only ours, and
-- everything a resource holds is released when it stops. So a bar cannot free a
-- player another module is holding, and a crash cannot leave them frozen for
-- the session.
