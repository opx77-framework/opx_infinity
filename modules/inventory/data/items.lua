--- The item catalogue: one definition per stored item name.
-- @author dop42
--
-- Data, and nothing else: `shared/catalog.lua` normalises every row once at load
-- and a malformed row becomes a boot warning rather than an error in the middle
-- of a request. MODEL is optional and draws a pile made for that item, and it is
-- a CURATED `Open77.props` alias. NOT a depot path: the API accepts a raw
-- `.mesh`, but the renderer matches a prebuilt host per alias, so the mesh draws
-- as a marker AND suppresses the crate fallback -- an id came back, so nothing
-- looks wrong anywhere. `shared/catalog.lua` refuses one at load.

	-- WEIGHT = 0, because weight is the one limit that can refuse HALF a move.
	-- `Containers.Move` splits a stack across slots, and a bag that fills up
	-- mid-transfer would leave a give or a deposit partly done with money on
	-- both sides of it. Slots still bound what anyone can carry, and a slot
	-- either takes the stack or does not. It is also the honest reading: an
	-- eddie is a number on a chip and a million of them weigh what one does.
	--
	-- USE with CONSUME = 0, because the CONSUME the catalogue performs happens
	-- AFTER the handler has returned, and a consume that failed there would
	-- have credited the balance and left the notes in the bag -- money minted,
	-- once per failure. `server/currency.lua` takes the units out ITSELF, before
	-- it credits anything, so the only failure left destroys nothing and mints
	-- nothing. The entry exists at all because it is what makes the screen draw
	-- a Use row for the stack.
	--
	-- DROP = false, because a pile on the ground is MEMORY ONLY: it is swept
	-- after DROPS.LIFETIME_MINUTES and nothing about it survives a restart. Any
	-- other item dropped and lost is an item; this one is somebody's wages,
	-- deleted with no line anywhere saying so. An operator who wants cash that
	-- can be robbed off the floor deletes this one word and accepts that.
