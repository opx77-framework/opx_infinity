--- Eddies you can hand over: the bridge between the balance and one item.
-- @author dop42
--
-- THE MODEL, AND IT IS THE WHOLE OF THIS FILE. The balance in `PlayerData.money`
-- stays the single authority on what anybody is worth. The `eddies` item is a
-- BEARER NOTE drawn against it:
--
--   * a WITHDRAW debits the balance and puts that many units in the bag (mint);
--   * USING the stack destroys it and credits the balance back (burn);
--   * everything in between -- handing it over, putting it in a boot, a stash or
--     a searched bag -- is the inventory module's existing machinery, untouched.
--
-- WHY NOT MAKE THE ITEM THE MONEY. Because every reader of the balance would
-- then have to read a bag instead, and there are eight of them across four
-- modules (shops, dealership, garages, the paycheck, the staff command). The day
-- one of them was missed, a player would pay for a car with money that was
-- sitting in a stash. A bearer note has the opposite property: a note is money
-- that is OUT of circulation, so the worst a missed reader can do is under-count,
-- and nothing can be spent twice.
--
-- WHAT THAT LEAVES TO GET WRONG, and it is the only thing:
--
--   TOTAL MONEY MUST NOT CHANGE. balance + notes held, before an operation,
--   equals balance + notes held after it -- including when the operation fails.
--
-- There is no transaction across a balance and a container: one lives in
-- PlayerData and the other in a container table written back on a timer, and
-- neither half can be rolled back by the other. So each conversion is an ORDERED
-- PAIR, and the order is chosen the same way both times:
--
--   THE STEP THAT CREATES VALUE GOES SECOND.
--
-- Mint first and a refused debit leaves notes nobody paid for -- money minted,
-- repeatably, by whoever finds the refusal. Debit first and a refused mint leaves
-- money owed -- destroyed once, and recoverable, which is what the compensating
-- step in each direction is for. A bridge that can only ever lose is a bridge an
-- operator can settle from the log; one that can gain is an economy nobody can.
--
-- Neither pair yields between its two halves, so nothing interleaves with one:
-- `RemoveMoney`/`AddMoney` publish PlayerData, raise the internal money event and
-- write an audit line, and not one of those reaches the database or waits; the
-- container calls mark a row dirty for a later sweep rather than writing it. The
-- bag is resolved BEFORE the pair, which is where the yield lives.
