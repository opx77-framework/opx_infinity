--- Who each player is, and the life of their bag.
-- @author dop42
--
-- A bag is loaded when a character enters the world, and written and forgotten
-- when it leaves. A client's word is never taken for a citizen id: the answer
-- comes from the `character` contract, which is the only thing that knows which
-- character a connection has loaded.
--
-- WHAT THIS RUNTIME DELETED. Who was loaded used to be read from another
-- resource's change cursor: one reader at a time, a generation token, a jump to
-- the head on the first read or when the other resource came back, a re-ask of
-- every known player, and one in-flight identity question per connection with a
-- 35-second wait behind it. In one Lua state a character loading is an event on
-- the internal channel and reading who is loaded is a function call.
