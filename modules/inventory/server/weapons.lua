--- Whether the engine says a weapon is drawn right now.
--
-- THE ONLY HONEST ANSWER TO "IS IT IN HAND", and the reason it is asked at all:
-- `armed[source]` is OUR record of what we last put there, and the game holsters
-- a weapon on its own often enough that the two drift. When they drift, Use --
-- which reads as a toggle -- puts away a weapon that is already away.
--
-- `Open77.weapons.get` is a CACHE and the platform says so plainly: "read it to
-- decide, never to assert". It carries two ages because its halves refresh at
-- different rates, and `fresh` applies a two-second rule to the half that
-- matters here -- `drawn` rides the ordinary 20 Hz player snapshot.
--
-- SO A STALE OR ABSENT ANSWER MEANS "DO NOT KNOW", AND DO-NOT-KNOW KEEPS THE OLD
-- BEHAVIOUR. `weapons_unreported` is a player the host has heard nothing from,
-- which is not the same as a player carrying nothing; a build without the call
-- is not a build where every weapon is holstered. Treating either as "not in
-- hand" would trade a rare wrong holster for a constant wrong draw.
