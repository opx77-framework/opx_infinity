--- The bag, the fixed stashes, vehicle storage and the piles on the ground.
-- @author dop42
--
-- The server is the only authority on what a container holds. Every request is
-- revalidated here -- slot, stack, weight, reach, readiness gate, life -- and the
-- screen only ever predicts: it draws a move, and the next push corrects it.
--
-- Three ideas run through the module and are worth having before reading it.
--
-- 1. A CONTAINER IS (KIND, OWNER). The bag of a character is `character` plus its
--    citizen id; an owned vehicle's trunk is `trunk` plus its PLATE, never a
--    runtime vehicle id, which belongs to one spawn and is recycled. A unique key
--    on the pair is what settles two simultaneous creators.
-- 2. A MEMORY-ONLY CONTAINER CARRIES A NEGATIVE ID. Piles and the storage of a
--    vehicle nobody owns are never written, and their ids come from a counter
--    that only ever goes down. A positive id is a row; a negative id is not.
-- 3. THE PAGE SENDS INTENTS. It reports a drag from one slot to another. Whether
--    that is legal, and what the bag then weighs, is decided here.
--
-- WHAT THIS RUNTIME DELETED. The two halves of this system used to live in two
-- resources, and a container was written by staging it across several export
-- calls under a transaction token, because one network argument caps at 48 KiB.
-- In one Lua state that is a function call: `server/storage.lua` writes a
-- container in one transaction and there is no protocol left to get wrong.
