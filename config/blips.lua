--- Map blips: the pins that tell a player where anything in this city is.
-- @author dop42
--
-- WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, in the owner's own words, said across several sessions:
-- "ce serais cool de voir des blips sur la minimap", and then, after a session
-- spent looking for them, "sur la map je vois pas les blips". He tested the
-- FULLSCREEN map as well and confirmed the same thing there: nothing.
--
-- ============================================================================
-- WHAT WAS ACTUALLY WRONG, AND IT WAS NOT WHAT WE THOUGHT
-- ============================================================================
--
-- The standing hypothesis was `config/hud.lua`'s `VANILLA.minimap = false`:
-- this HUD hides the game's minimap, so -- the reasoning went -- it must be
-- hiding the pins with it, on both surfaces.
--
-- HALF OF THAT IS TRUE AND IT IS NOT THE HALF THAT MATTERED. Measured against
-- the platform's own component table (`open77_guide hud-visibility#components`,
-- build 2.31.13+op77.76), the `minimap` component controls, verbatim:
--
--     "Map panel, geometry, player marker, MAPPINS, GPS lines, frame and
--      location label"
--
-- So yes -- hiding `minimap` does hide mappins ON THE MINIMAP. But the
-- FULLSCREEN WORLD MAP IS NOT ONE OF THE THIRTEEN COMPONENTS `Open77.hud`
-- governs at all. There is no switch in that table that touches it, and hiding
-- the minimap cannot suppress it. The owner's own test -- open the big map,
-- still nothing -- is therefore evidence AGAINST the hypothesis rather than for
-- it, and it was the thing that pointed at the real cause.
--
-- THE REAL CAUSE IS THAT THIS RUNTIME HAD NEVER CREATED A BLIP. Not one. Before
-- this file, `grep -rn "blips" .` over the whole tree returned ZERO lines:
-- no `Open77.blips` call, no `ui.vanilla.map` in `open77.lua`, no module. There
-- was nothing to hide. The map was empty because it was empty.
--
-- That is worth writing down plainly, because "the HUD is eating them" is a
-- much more interesting explanation than "we never wrote it", and an afternoon
-- can be spent on the interesting one.
--
-- ============================================================================
-- THE MINIMAP: WHAT THE CHOICE ACTUALLY COSTS
-- ============================================================================
--
-- THERE IS ONE SWITCH AND IT IS NOT IN THIS FILE. It is `VANILLA.minimap` in
-- `config/hud.lua`, and it is deliberately left there rather than mirrored
-- here: two files claiming the same component is how a hide ends up fighting a
-- show, and this tree has a comment against that seam on nearly every module.
--
--   minimap = true   (the default this work set)
--     The player gets the game's minimap back, and the blips below appear on
--     the minimap AND on the fullscreen map. This is what the owner asked for,
--     in as many words. The cost is a vanilla panel in the corner of a screen
--     the rest of which is ours.
--
--   minimap = false  (what it was)
--     The corner stays clean. The blips below STILL WORK -- they are still on
--     the fullscreen map, because that surface is not governed by the component
--     -- but nothing shows on the minimap, because there is no minimap.
--
-- WHY THE DEFAULT WAS FLIPPED. The other twelve hides in `config/hud.lua` are
-- each paid for: this runtime draws its own health, its own stamina, its own
-- clock, its own notifications. `minimap` was the ONE entry in that list where
-- we hide the game's version and draw NOTHING in its place -- `grep -rin
-- "minimap|radar" ui/ web/` finds a single CSS comment and no component. So
-- the old default took the player's map away and handed back an empty corner,
-- which is a straight loss, and it is the whole of the owner's complaint.
--
-- If the clean screen is worth more than the map, set it back to `false` in
-- `config/hud.lua`; the blips stay on the fullscreen map either way, and the
-- blips module says which of the two is in force in its boot note, so the
-- answer is in the server journal rather than in somebody's memory.
--
-- ============================================================================
-- COLOUR: PER BLIP SINCE THE NATIVE INK ADAPTER GREW ONE
-- ============================================================================
--
-- THIS SECTION USED TO SAY THERE CANNOT BE A COLOUR SETTING, and it was true
-- when it was written (build 2.31.13+op77.76): `Open77.blips` refused `color`
-- by name, a Cyberpunk mappin carries no colour field of its own, and the only
-- colour a pin had was the one baked into its sprite. That is why `SPRITE`
-- below is named for what it does, and that part stands -- picking `danger`
-- over `objective` is still how a blip becomes red with no tint at all.
--
-- WHAT CHANGED is the platform's own per-widget Ink adapter: `color` is now a
-- real `create`/`update`/`setColor` field, exactly `#RRGGBB`/`#RRGGBBAA` (the
-- alpha bytes live in it, because `alpha` is refused), and a custom SVG `icon`
-- compiles under the real mappin widget. So a CATEGORY may carry `COLOR`
-- below, and -- the case the owner asked for -- a headquarters station names
-- its OWN sprite, icon and colour per station, in `config/headquarters.lua`'s
-- `BLIP` block. The engine still refuses `colour`, `alpha`, `opacity`, `scale`,
-- `category`, `shortRange` and `kind` by name, and a boot warning names those.
--
-- WHAT IS STILL TRUE and worth keeping: a per-blip colour touches only the one
-- pin (the platform's own measurements: opacity and scale remain per SPRITE,
-- on the shared UI runtime profile), and an operator who writes the British
-- spelling gets a boot warning naming the category rather than a key that is
-- quietly dropped. The platform's own guide makes that argument better than
-- this comment can: "A property accepted and silently discarded is worse than
-- one that is missing, because nothing in the resource can tell the difference."
--
-- ============================================================================
-- SPRITES, AND WHICH ONES ARE ACTUALLY ON THE BIG MAP
-- ============================================================================
--
-- `SPRITE` takes a stable alias, an exact 2.31 variant name, or an integer
-- 0..146. The aliases, from the platform guide, are:
--
--   default   objective  quest     important  question   fast_travel
--   vehicle   loot       danger    vendor     apartment  stash      wardrobe
--   bar       clothes    cyberware drop_point food       guns       junk
--   meds      ripperdoc  tech      race       ncart      fixer      tarot
--   ping_door ping_go_here  ping_loot  remote_player
--
-- A WARNING THE GUIDE GIVES AND THIS FILE REPEATS, because it is exactly the
-- failure the owner already reported once: "HUD-only variants can still be
-- ABSENT FROM THE FULLSCREEN MAP; use a map-capable sprite such as `objective`,
-- `quest`, `fast_travel`, `vehicle`, or a service-point variant when map
-- selection is required." Every default below is from that safe set or is a
-- `ServicePoint*` variant. Change one to a `ping_*` or `remote_player` and the
-- pin may live on the HUD only -- which would read, again, as "je vois pas les
-- blips".
--
-- ============================================================================
-- WHERE THE POSITIONS COME FROM -- AND WHY THIS FILE HOLDS NONE
-- ============================================================================
--
-- NOT ONE COORDINATE IS WRITTEN HERE, ON PURPOSE. Every category below names a
-- source that already owns its positions, and a coordinate copied into this
-- file would be a second opinion that drifts the first time somebody moves a
-- garage. `lib/shared/spots.lua` makes that argument at length for the five
-- modules that place things; this is the same argument one level up.
--
--   garages, dealership  DATABASE, not config. `config/garages.lua`'s SPOTS is
--                        two examples; the live list is captured in game with
--                        `/opx.garages.add` and lives in `opx77_garages`. The
--                        client is told its own bucket's list over the module's
--                        SYNC event, so the blips are read from the garages and
--                        dealership clients' own `Runtime.Spots()`.
--   teleports            config, but STILL served over the wire, because the
--                        server marks each entrance allowed or refused for this
--                        player. Read from `Runtime.Entrances()`.
--   shops                static `OPX.Config.MODULES.shops.SHOPS`, a
--                        `shared_script`, read directly -- no event carries it.
--   jobs                 static, and TWO sources: every gunsmith armoury's
--                        BENCH, and every hauling site's DROPOFFS.
--   headquarters         DATABASE positions, CONFIG look. The list is the
--                        headquarters client's own `Runtime.Spots()` (captured
--                        stations live in `opx77_headquarters` and the server
--                        filters to the asker's bucket); the pin look is per
--                        station, the `BLIP` block of the station's row in
--                        `config/headquarters.lua`. A station with no `BLIP`
--                        block is deliberately not pinned -- the pin is the
--                        station's own choice, not this module's opinion.
--
-- A POINT WHOSE X, Y AND Z ARE ALL EXACTLY ZERO IS SKIPPED AND COUNTED. Most of
-- `config/gunsmith.lua` and all of `config/hauling.lua` ship as unsurveyed
-- placeholders and say so in their own headers; `config/elevators.lua` is the
-- cautionary tale both of them cite. A pin at the world origin is a pin in the
-- sea, and four of them would read as this feature being broken rather than as
-- the config being unfilled.

OPX.Config.MODULES.blips = {
	enabled = true,

	-- Milliseconds between two reconciliations of the drawn set against the
	-- sources. This is NOT a per-frame scan: nothing here moves, and the only
	-- reason to look again is that a spot was captured, a bucket changed, or a
	-- job gate opened. Four seconds is slower than the 500 ms the marker scans
	-- use because a marker is a thing you walk into and a blip is a thing you
	-- read on a map you opened.
	SCAN_MS = 4000,

	-- Blips created before the thread yields. THE REASON THIS NUMBER EXISTS is
	-- `modules/admin/client/target.lua`'s `register()` and the four outages in
	-- its comment: a client resume has an INSTRUCTION BUDGET, and a loop that
	-- creates several dozen engine handles in one pass runs out of it partway
	-- down, at which point THE COROUTINE UNWINDS WITH NO ERROR, NO LOG AND NO
	-- REFUSAL. Half the blips would be up, the rest would never exist, and
	-- nothing anywhere would say so.
	--
	-- Blips are exactly that shape: dozens of engine calls, all at start. So the
	-- reconcile yields every BATCH creations, on a thread of its own.
	BATCH = 8,

	-- The most blips this module will create. THE PLATFORM'S OWN QUOTA IS 128
	-- PER RESOURCE and 512 per client; this is that number and not a taste. A
	-- server that captures its 140th garage gets a boot note naming the count
	-- and the cap instead of a silent refusal on the 129th create.
	MAX = 128,

	-- Each category: whether it is drawn, which vanilla sprite it wears (which,
	-- per the long note above, IS its colour), the words that name it, and how
	-- far away it stays visible.
	--
	-- RANGE is metres, 0..4000, and 0 MEANS NO GATE -- always visible. It is
	-- Open77's own doing rather than an engine field: it measures the distance
	-- on the game thread and drives `SetMappinActive` on a transition. It is
	-- NOT FiveM's `SetBlipAsShortRange`: Cyberpunk has no per-surface control,
	-- so out of range means off on the HUD, the minimap AND the world map, not
	-- "off the minimap, still on the big map". A value outside 0..4000 is
	-- refused by the engine with `invalid_range` and is refused here at boot.
	--
	-- WALLS is `visibleThroughWalls`. Left false everywhere: these are map pins,
	-- and a garage glowing through the building in front of you is a HUD effect
	-- nobody asked for.
