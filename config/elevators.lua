--- Elevators: the gate, the scan and every lift.
-- @author dop42
--
-- The durable name of an elevator is its key here: the id the host gives an
-- adopted lift changes at every restart. A floor is named by its NATIVE index,
-- never by its place in FLOORS.
--
-- A distance is measured ACROSS THE GROUND against the DECLARED position, in X
-- and Y; Z is validated and then ignored. So a lift is called from every floor
-- of its own shaft, and someone on the twelfth is as near the panel as someone
-- in the lobby.
--
-- JOBS is job name -> minimum grade level. REASON and LABEL are the operator's
-- own words and are never translated.
--
-- TRAVEL_MS, REQUEST_WINDOW_MS and REQUESTS_PER_WINDOW are also declared as
-- tunables by the server half; the values below are what they fall back to.
--
-- THE FOUR ELEVATORS BELOW ARE SAMPLES AND THEIR X/Y/Z ARE PLACEHOLDERS. They
-- were carried over verbatim from the standalone `opx77_elevators`, whose README
-- said so and whose warning did not survive the port -- so the config has since
-- read as a description of this server's world when it never was one. Not one of
-- the four positions was surveyed against a real shaft, and FLOOR_COUNT and every
-- FLOORS INDEX are guesses in the same way: a floor index is the NATIVE per-lift
-- index, which no one can know without standing at the lift.
--
-- Nothing here is wrong in a way `Access.Problems` can see. It checks shape --
-- finite coordinates, whole indexes inside FLOOR_COUNT, a LABEL on every row --
-- and a placeholder passes all of it. The failure is silent and it is total:
-- `Access.Locate` matches a sighted lift to a key only within MATCH_RADIUS metres
-- of the position declared here, so a position that is off by more than six
-- metres matches nothing, no lift is ever adopted, and no panel ever opens.
--
-- To make these real, stand at each shaft and read the lift off the client
-- developer console:
--
--   resource.emit open77:elevators:nearby 100
--
-- which lists every streamed native LiftDevice -- unmanaged ones included -- with
-- its engine hash and its exact position. Put that position in X/Y/Z, put the
-- hash in ENTITY when two shafts share a lobby, and take FLOOR_COUNT from the
-- device rather than from the storey count of the building.
