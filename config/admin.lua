-- No secret and no grant lives here. This file is a shared script that every
-- client downloads, and the ACL is the host's: the access map the menu is sent
-- only greys out what the host would refuse anyway.
--
-- LINKS names OTHER modules' command names, so that a renamed command is
-- followed here rather than in code, and `false` removes the row that drives it.
-- They are command names and not contract calls on purpose: a command is
-- resolved against `command.<name>` by the host before its handler runs, and a
-- contract call from a client would be no permission check at all.
--
-- The numbers marked "tunable" below are the DEFAULTS of a panel entry. They are
-- declared from the module's `Init` and read at the moment of use, so an operator
-- moves them while people are playing; everything else here is read at start.
