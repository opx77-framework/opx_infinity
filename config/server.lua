	-- WHO MAY CALL THE CREATOR EXPORTS, `core/server/exports.lua`. The caller is
	-- the resource name the HOST reports (`GetInvokingResource`), never one an
	-- argument claims, and a refused call answers `export.callerDenied` and is
	-- written to the audit log with the name it came from.
	--
	--   READ     who may ASK: GetPlayerData, GetMoney, HasJob, HasItem, IsStaff
	--            and the other reads. '*' is every resource on the host -- the
	--            answers are what the player state bag already publishes, plus a
	--            balance and a bag count -- or a set: { my_hud = true }.
	--   WRITERS  who may CHANGE something: money, items, stashes, chat lines,
	--            keys, a vehicle's state, a job, a gang, duty, a revive, and
	--            the caller's own character metadata. EMPTY OUT OF THE BOX, on purpose: a
	--            write export is a money printer for whichever resource holds
	--            it, and the operator is the one who decides which of the
	--            resources they installed is trusted with that. The first refused
	--            call from a resource prints the exact line to add here.
	--            `'*'` admits every resource and is for a development server.
	--   STAFF_PERMISSION
	--            the ACL right `IsStaff` asks about. The right that opens the
	--            staff menu, so "staff" means the same thing everywhere.

	-- `config/admin.lua`'s LINKS block names, and what the staff menu and the eye
	-- run. The value is a convenience that lives alongside it, and an operator who
	-- empties this table loses nothing but the typing.
	--
	-- A VALUE THE HOST WILL NOT GIVE US IS SKIPPED, NOT FATAL. This session also
	-- runs open77_shell, open77_pause, open77_voice, open-voice, open77_weapons,
	-- open77_interactions and open77_props, and a bare word is a far likelier
	-- collision than a prefixed one -- `open77_weather` ships a plain `weather`
	-- command, which is the shape of the thing. If one of these is already taken,
	-- `core/server/commands.lua` logs the name and the reason and moves on.
	--
	-- WHAT IS DELIBERATELY ABSENT, because symmetry is the wrong goal here:
	--   * `opx.admin` itself. It is the grant that makes somebody staff, `admin`
	--     is the single likeliest bare name for another resource to own, and the
	--     menu is already on F9.
	--   * everything irreversible: `...moderate.ban`, `...moderate.kick`,
	--     `...player.kill`, `...character.delete`, `opx.delete`. A bare `ban` or
	--     `kill` is a word you can type by accident, and none of them can be
	--     taken back. Typing the long name is friction that matches the
	--     consequence.
	--   * the generic nouns -- `save`, `give`, `list`, `add`, `open`, `set`,
	--     `money`, `status`, `time`, `weather`. Claiming one of those out of the
	--     session-wide namespace is asking for the collision, and half of them
	--     say nothing about which of eight commands they mean.
