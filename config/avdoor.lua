--- The AV door: walk up to an aircraft you may fly, see the row, press the key.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- THE OWNER, 2026-09-29: "not being able to reboard the maxtac av after
-- landing ... i dont even see press f ... fix properly". Measured in the client
-- log of that session: the pad seated the pilot the moment the hull existed
-- (`LOCALSEAT seat=seat_front_left`), the flight was eleven minutes, the exit
-- at 22:49:47 was clean -- and after it there was no way back in. The base
-- game authors NO entry interaction on an aircraft (V boards one in a scene),
-- so the only door an AV ever had was the pad's hand-off at the moment it was
-- recalled, and the MaxTac crew door that is open for twenty seconds at the
-- street. Step out anywhere else and the aircraft was a statue.
--
-- THIS IS THAT DOOR, FOR EVERY AIRCRAFT. On foot, within `REACH_METRES` of a
-- parked AV you may fly, the strip shows `KEY` and the press seats you through
-- the platform's own authoritative mount (`warpPlayerIntoVehicle`) -- the same
-- call the pad and the crew door already use. THE SERVER FINDS THE DOOR: it
-- is the only side that holds world coordinates for a vehicle (a client
-- snapshot carries none, `wiki/vehicles.md`), so every `SCAN_MS` it measures
-- each player on foot against every aircraft in their bucket and tells the
-- client which door, if any, is open to them. Who may fly what is decided from
-- the server's own reads: the character a pad issued the hull to, an on-duty
-- holder of the job a job aircraft belongs to, or whatever rule the module that
-- owns the hull registered (the MaxTac insertion parks its aircraft here once
-- its crew has stepped out). `/opx.avdoor.why` says, for the aircraft nearest
-- to you, what the door answers and why.
--
-- ALSO HERE, because they are the same aircraft seen from the other side:
--   * the EXIT, which the platform performs with no animation -- its animated
--     AV exit crashed the game and is switched off in its own client
--     (`VehicleReplication.cpp`: "cockpit records author no humanoid exit
--     workspot"), so the body is carried out in one cut. The fade below turns
--     that cut into a scene change instead of a pop, the guard puts the body
--     on the ground beside the seat's door, and the server swings that door
--     open for everybody to see (see EXIT);
--   * the MaxTac AV's own VOICE when a player flies one: the base game's
--     ascent, descent and landing-horn events, played on the airframe for
--     everybody near it.
--
-- THE OWNER, 2026-09-29, three things in one message, each measured before it
-- was changed:
--   "make sure maxtac av sound is heard from all players not just the pilot" --
--   the relay now sends every listener near the hull the sound, the pilot
--   included, each listener's client answers what it did with it (the server
--   journals the answer), and a listener the host refused is given the sound
--   through the platform's own fan-out instead (SOUNDS.RESCUE);
--   "make sure other players can mount in av" -- PASSENGERS is on, and a hull
--   whose owner's rule refuses somebody is no longer refused to them outright;
--   "the player gets thrown out av and the av door doesnt open for some" -- the
--   client log of 2026-09-29 21:04:35 has the whole exit to the millisecond
--   (t = the platform's `vexit-anim-off`): the mount drops at +0.0 s and the
--   engine puts the body at the cockpit's exit point, INSIDE the hull; at
--   +0.1 s the platform wakes the chassis for 230 ms and at +0.38 s it
--   reports a car impact on the body (`impulse=474`, and a knock-down cue);
--   at +1.6 s its foot camera cuts in and about +1.7 s its own deferred eject
--   moves the body 3.5 m behind and 2 m UNDER the hull's centre. The old fade
--   was back before +1.5 s, so the player SAW the throw and the eject. The
--   door the platform opens is a local actuation, reported by a parked owner
--   that the same exit has just dropped (`vowner-loss ... mounted=0`), so
--   nobody else was ever told it opened.

	-- through buildings but when i move it comes back to same spot on other play
	-- screen". The pilot's own client log of that flight cannot show it -- the
	-- pilot's screen is the one that was right -- and nothing on the server wrote a
	-- line about an aircraft's authority, so the drift left no evidence anywhere a
	-- log collection reaches. This block is that evidence, on both sides:
	--
	--   * EVERY CLIENT, every `SIGHT_MS`, compares where its engine DRAWS each
	--     aircraft it does not simulate itself (the entity's own frame) with
	--     where the server's last sample put it (the client snapshot), for the
	--     nearest `MAX_HULLS` within `RANGE`. Drawn more than `DRIFT_METRES` away
	--     (plus `DRIFT_PER_SPEED` metres per m/s the hull is moving, because an
	--     observer draws a moving hull a jitter buffer behind its newest sample)
	--     opens an EPISODE: one line in that client's log and one report to the
	--     server, which writes it to ITS journal with its own reads beside it --
	--     the physics owner, the epoch, who is seated, the freeze. Under
	--     `SETTLE_METRES` twice in a row closes it, with how long it lasted and
	--     how far it got. An open episode is reported again every `REPEAT_MS`.
	--   * THE SERVER journals every change of an aircraft's physics owner
	--     (`onVehicleAuthorityChanged`, with the platform's reason) and every
	--     canonical move bigger than `JUMP_METRES` between two scans, which is
	--     faster than any AV flies.
	--   * `HEAL`: an EMPTY, unfrozen aircraft that a client reports drawing far
	--     from where the server has it is re-published where it stands
	--     (`setTransform` to its own canonical pose and heading), which starts a
	--     new authority epoch and makes every viewer drop its buffered path and
	--     draw the hull where the server has it. At most once per `HEAL_EVERY_MS`
	--     per hull, and never with anybody aboard: a seated pilot's lease is
	--     theirs, and a server pose would fight it.

	-- ground the static ray finds there -- and keeps it there for `GUARD_MS`:
	-- a jump of more than `JUMP_METRES` between two looks (50 ms) is the
	-- platform's own eject putting it back under the hull, and it is put back.
	-- The platform's hull is `halfW=5.00` in its own log, so 6 m is a metre
	-- clear of it; `REACH_METRES` (9 m) still covers it, so the door row is up
	-- the moment the screen is. A body still inside `DANGER_METRES` of the

	-- beside the door at the door's own height and falls from there, and is
	-- never carried down to the ground. A seat lost more than `NEAR_METRES`
