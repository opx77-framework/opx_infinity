--- Where an owned vehicle may be brought out, and the glowing markers that say so.
-- @author XEROX710
--
-- A GARAGE IS A NAME, AND A NAME MAY BE IN SEVERAL PLACES. That is the whole of
-- the rework, in the owner's own words: "change les system de garage". Before
-- it, a garage WAS a point -- one marker, one key, one car out where the marker
-- stood -- so a player who stored a car in Watson could only ever fetch it in
-- Watson, and an operator who wanted the same garage on two sides of a building
-- had to make two garages and file the cars under one of them.
--
-- So a garage is a KEY with a list of LOCATIONS, and each location is three
-- different kinds of point:
--
--   MENU   where the list opens. It shows EVERY vehicle filed under this
--          garage's key, whichever location it was stored at -- that is what
--          makes storing in Watson and fetching in Japantown one garage rather
--          than two.
--   ENTRY  the ONE point a vehicle is taken in at. One, deliberately: driving in
--          is a thing you do at a door, and two doors to one garage is two
--          places a player has to guess between.
--   EXITS  the points a vehicle comes OUT at, tried IN THE ORDER WRITTEN. The
--          first one with nothing parked on it wins. When every one of them is
--          occupied the bring-out is REFUSED and the player is told so, which is
--          the owner's own choice over the two alternatives -- queueing behind a
--          car nobody may move, or spawning on top of it.
--
-- THE KEY IS WHAT A VEHICLE'S `garage` COLUMN HOLDS, and it is the same key the
-- points used to be named by, which is why no row anywhere had to be rewritten
-- for this: `garage1` was a spot and is now a garage, and every car filed under
-- `garage1` still comes out of it.
--
-- THE COMMANDS THAT PLACED A SPOT ARE GONE. `/opx.garages.add` and
-- `/opx.garages.remove` wrote into `opx77_garages`, so the shape of the world
-- lived in a table nobody had a copy of. A garage is written here now. The
-- module still READS that table at boot and adopts anything in it that this file
-- does not name -- see `modules/garages/server/main.lua`, "the legacy adoption"
-- -- and prints each one as the block to paste in here, so nothing an operator
-- ever placed is lost by the commands going away. `/opx.garages.export` hands
-- the same blocks to a person in game, on demand.
--
-- KIND decides what may come out: a `garage` brings out a ground vehicle, an
-- `avpad` brings out an AV record. It belongs to the GARAGE and not to a point,
-- because a garage that took cars in at one location and AVs at another would be
-- a garage whose own list means two things.
--
-- X, Y and Z are validated, and only X and Y are measured against: a pad on a
-- roof is used by someone standing on the roof, and someone on the street below
-- it is not near it. HEADING is the yaw a vehicle is created with, so it is a
-- field of ENTRY and of an EXIT and NOT of MENU -- nothing is created at a menu
-- point, and a heading on a record nothing turns is a field a later author wires
-- up by mistake.
--
-- HOW TO CAPTURE ONE OF THOSE POINTS. Stand on it, FACE THE WAY A CAR COMING
-- OUT SHOULD FACE, and run `/opx.admin.self.pos` -- Self -> Position on the
-- staff menu, or the row on the target eye. It copies
-- `{ NAME = "here", LABEL = "Here", X = ..., Y = ..., Z = ..., HEADING = ... }`
-- to your operating system clipboard, with the facing you are really standing
-- at, and you paste the numbers into a MENU, an ENTRY or an EXIT below. That is
-- the whole capture path on this server. It is a COMMAND and not a menu on
-- purpose: the owner deleted the staff menu's Dev screen on 2026-09-21 --
-- "il y a pas de config live c'est tous par les fichier config donc degage moi
-- ce menu est pass moi tous dans les config" -- because a screen that places
-- things teaches an operator to set a server up somewhere nobody can read
-- afterwards. This command places nothing. It reads a number and hands it to
-- you, and you put it in the file.
--
-- The marker vocabulary is fixed by the engine and not by this file: styles are
-- `interaction`, `objective`, `spawn` and `danger`, shapes are `ring` and
-- `cylinder`, RADIUS is 0.1..50 and MAX_DISTANCE is 1..500. Anything else is
-- answered `unsupported_style`/`unsupported_shape` by `Open77.markers`, which is
-- why every preset below glows with a stock style rather than a custom one.

	-- ── THE JOB FLEET: the vehicles a job brings with it ────────────────────
	--
	-- "give all maxtac and ncpd workers the vehicles they need in there garage
	-- with proper labels" and "required avs for the role job needs to be in the
	-- garage for players by defualt" -- the owner's words. Every row below is in
	-- the garage list of every holder of its job, at its grade and above, BY
	-- DEFAULT: nothing is bought, granted or issued first, and a member hired
	-- today and one hired a year ago find the same rows the moment they open a
	-- garage.
	--
	-- WHERE A ROW SHOWS. At every garage of the right KIND the player may use: a
	-- ground vehicle at every `garage`, an AV at every `avpad` -- the MaxTac
	-- hangars of `config/avgarages.lua` included, behind their own gate as
	-- always. Which of the two a row is, is the record's own fact, decided by the
	-- one AV rule (`AV_MATCHES` in `config/shared.lua`), never written here.
	-- NCPD's AV therefore needs a pad NCPD may use: the MaxTac hangars are
	-- MaxTac's, so give the station a public `KIND = 'avpad'` garage in GARAGES
	-- above -- a public pad lists the NCPD AV to NCPD alone, at its grade and on
	-- duty, and everybody else's own AVs to them as before.
	--
	-- WHO. The job is the character's PRIMARY job, at the row's grade or above,
	-- and clocked on when `ON_DUTY` is true (the default) -- the job gate
	-- `lib/shared/jobgate.lua`, the same decision the MaxTac pads make. A grade
	-- block holds what that grade ADDS: an Officer takes out everything a Cadet
	-- does, and more. A job or a grade `config/character.lua` does not define
	-- is refused at boot rather than listed to nobody.
	--
	-- WHAT THEY ARE. JOB VEHICLES, NEVER OWNED. A row is signed out, not given:
	-- it has no plate and no row in `opx77_vehicles`, so it cannot be sold,
	-- handed over, stored as a car of their own or counted against the ownership
	-- ceiling, and its boot holds nothing past the vehicle. One of each row per
	-- member: picking one that is already out brings it to the exit, the way a
	-- car of their own is recalled. Driven into a garage door it goes back to
	-- the pool. It goes back on its own when the holder leaves the job, drops
	-- below its grade, clocks off or changes character -- the moment nobody is
	-- sitting in it (JOB_SWEEP_MS above), because nothing is pulled out from
	-- under a driver -- and at once when the holder leaves the server.
	--
	--   KEY     the row's durable name, unique across this whole block: what a
	--           list row and a request carry. Letters, digits, `_ - .`
	--   RECORD  the TweakDB vehicle record, as a spawn names it
	--   LABEL   the catalogue key of its name, in `modules/garages/locales.lua`
	--           beside every language the server carries. Plain words work too
	--           -- a key the catalogue does not hold reads as itself -- but a
	--           list read in two languages wants a key
	--   APPEARANCE  optional: the livery, one of the appearance names the
	--           record's entity template carries. The vehicle is created in
	--           it, on every player's game. Absent, the record's own livery
	--
	-- THE SHIPPED ROWS ARE THE BASE GAME'S OWN POLICE RECORDS, the player-usable
	-- ones the NCPD prevention records (`config/ncpd.lua` LADDER) are built on,
	-- climbing with rank the way the heat ladder climbs: the Cortes of Heat 1
	-- for a Cadet, the Hella and the Apollo bike of Heats 2 and 3 for an
	-- Officer, the Emperor and the Merrimac of Heat 4 for a Detective, the
	-- Hellhound of Heat 5 for the Captain. MaxTac's are its own: the Merrimac
	-- in MaxTac livery and `Vehicle.max_tac_av`, the Surveyor the division's
	-- insertion flies (`config/ncpd.lua` MAXTAC.AV).
	--
	-- THE TWO AIRCRAFT. The platform flies as an AV only a `Vehicle.av_*`
	-- record, or exactly `Vehicle.max_tac_av`; anything else comes out as a car
	-- that cannot leave the ground. So:
	--   * the NCPD air unit is `Vehicle.av_zetatech_atlus` in the Atlus's own
	--     NCPD livery, `zetatech_atlus_ncpd_01` -- the airframe the base game
	--     puts in NCPD service (`Vehicle.sq026_av_ncpd` is the same Atlus with
	--     that livery). `Vehicle.q001_police_av`, the prologue's police AV, is
	--     not an `av_*` record and never flew. A civilian's Atlus keeps its own
	--     livery: the appearance belongs to this row, not to the record.
	--   * MaxTac's `Vehicle.max_tac_av` names the base game's CLOAKED livery,
	--     invisible but for its stickers and thrusters, so it comes out in the
	--     same airframe's visible MaxTac livery, `zetatech_surveyor__basic_ep1_maxtac_01`.
	--     opx_sandy_view's `OpxMaxTacAv.reds` draws that livery on every game
	--     as well, for a Surveyor created without one.
	-- An AV row shows at an `avpad` the player may use. The MaxTac hangars of
	-- `config/avgarages.lua` are MaxTac's; NCPD's AV needs a public
	-- `KIND = 'avpad'` garage in GARAGES above (docs/ncpd-maxtac.md, section 8).
