--- Characters, money, groups and the definitions behind them.

-- The module reads this as `M.Settings`. It ships to every client in the signed
-- resource set, so nothing secret belongs here -- an entry in SLOTS_BY_USER names
-- an account id and travels with it.
--
-- JOBS, GANGS and ORIGINS are definitions, not settings: the key is what is
-- written on a character's row, so rows are added freely and NEVER renamed --
-- renaming one renames what players already own. Grades are indexed from 0 and
-- contiguous. `none` is the absence of a gang, kept as an entry so that nothing
-- has to handle nil. `unemployed` has `defaultDuty = true`: there is nowhere to
-- clock in, so its small wage asks for no shift.

		-- HOW `opx.select` MOVES AN ACCOUNT ONTO ANOTHER CHARACTER. Two values,
		-- and no third:
		--
		--   'relog'      take the other character here, in the world. The one
		--                being left is saved and waited on, the other is loaded
		--                and placed, and the client reloads the body family, the
		--                face and the clothes onto the puppet it already has. No
		--                disconnect, no loading screen, no re-queue.
		--   'reconnect'  move the lock and end the session, so the next connection
		--                arrives on the new character. What this did before the
		--                setting existed.
		--
		-- A REFUSED RELOG FALLS BACK TO THE RECONNECT rather than leaving the
		-- player on the character they asked to leave. The save of the outgoing
		-- character is the one thing that can refuse it -- the switch is abandoned
		-- rather than losing what was not written -- and the player is then
		-- disconnected, which saves it again on the way out.
		--
		-- `opx.create` IS NOT COVERED BY THIS AND CANNOT BE. A new character has
		-- no body, so it needs the game's own character creator, and that creator
		-- belongs to the game's MAIN MENU: it is drawn for the character-bootstrap
		-- transaction, which is spent before the world exists. Resetting the
		-- bootstrap mid-session was measured in game on 2026-09-17 (2.31.13+op77.81)
		-- -- the request is granted, the phase moves on, and NO CREATOR IS EVER
		-- DRAWN, because the game is no longer in its main menu. The shell takes
		-- the world down for a bootstrap it now expects answered and the player
		-- sits under the loading cover until they kill the connection. The
		-- platform has a disconnect native and no reconnect, so there is nothing
		-- softer to offer. `opx.create` ends the session whatever is written here.
		--
		-- WHY 'relog' IS NOT OBVIOUSLY RIGHT, and is a setting rather than the
		-- only behaviour: a switch in the world is a save, a load, a kill-respawn
		-- placement and -- when the two characters are not the same body family --
		-- a covered body reload, all while the player is incarnated and other
		-- players can see them. 'reconnect' does all of that behind a join, where
		-- it has always run. If a switch ever leaves somebody in the wrong body or
		-- under a cover that does not lift, this is the one word to change back.

		-- An unknown value is REFUSED WITH A LINE IN THE JOURNAL and falls back to
		-- 'reconnect'.
