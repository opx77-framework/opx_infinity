--- Hauling: the sites, the crates, the vehicles that carry them and the pay.
-- @author dop42
--
-- A SITE IS A LIST OF POINTS AND A LIST OF DROP-OFFS. The server puts one crate
-- on each free point, players race to claim one, carry it, load it into a
-- vehicle, drive it to a drop-off and are paid. There is no `/start`: the ALT
-- target eye on a crate is the whole entry, and a site is "open" for as long as
-- it has crates on it.
--
-- `POINTS` IS THE STRUCTURAL CAP ON THE REFILL LOOP. One crate per point, so the
-- loop cannot overfill the world: there is nowhere to put an extra crate. That
-- is the first of three belts. `MAX_CRATES` below is the second, counted across
-- every site. The platform's own ceiling -- 2,048 props per resource, 8,192 in
-- the registry -- is the third and the only one that is not ours to move.
--
-- ============================================================================
-- EVERY POSITION IN THIS FILE IS A PLACEHOLDER AND THE MODULE REFUSES TO USE ONE
-- ============================================================================
--
-- `config/elevators.lua` in this same tree is the cautionary tale and the reason
-- this block is written the way it is. Four lifts shipped with positions carried
-- over from a standalone resource that had said they were samples; the warning
-- did not survive the port, the coordinates passed every shape check the
-- validator made -- finite numbers, whole indexes, a LABEL on every row -- and
-- they matched nothing in Night City. The failure was silent and it was total:
-- no lift was ever adopted and no panel ever opened, for weeks, with a green
-- test suite behind it.
--
-- So a point whose X, Y and Z are all exactly zero is treated here as what it
-- is -- an unfilled blank -- and a SITE THAT HOLDS ONE IS DISABLED at boot with
-- a line naming it. Nothing is spawned there. That is deliberately louder than a
-- warning: a hauling job whose crates never appear looks exactly like a hauling
-- job nobody has walked past yet, and the operator would have no way to tell.
--
-- To make a site real, stand on each spot in game and read your own position off
-- the client developer console, then paste it into a POINTS row. The same for
-- each DROPOFFS entry. Points must be at least MIN_POINT_GAP metres apart, or
-- two crates spawn inside each other and the target eye can only ever pick the
-- nearer one.
--
-- THE MODEL IS A CURATED ALIAS AND NEVER A `.mesh` PATH. A raw depot mesh path
-- renders as placeholder geometry AND CANNOT BE ATTACHED AT ALL -- which for
-- this job means the pickup succeeds, the crate vanishes into the carrier, and
-- nothing is ever visibly carried. `crate.small` is the default because it is
-- the one alias in the shipped examples that has actually been carried and
-- hand-tuned by somebody standing in front of it.
--
-- `Open77.props.catalog()` ON THE SERVER IS ALWAYS AN EMPTY TABLE, so a MODEL
-- cannot be checked against a list here. The server half checks it by TRYING:
-- at boot it creates one crate at a site's first point, and a site whose model
-- answers `unknown_alias` is disabled with a line rather than left to spawn
-- nothing for the rest of the session.

	-- itself, so aiming is exact.
	--
	-- `world` is the fallback for a build whose screen ray does not report a
	-- server-owned prop as `kind = 'prop'`. It registers one row against any bare
	-- surface and matches the hit POINT against the crate positions the server
	-- pushed, within REACH. Still one row, still no periodic job -- but the player
	-- aims at the ground near the crate rather than at the crate.

	-- the arms do, which is what a two-handed carry looks like. A slot the rig
	-- does not expose hides the crate entirely, and "" always exists.
	--
	-- OFFSET is metres in that slot's own frame, each axis within 20; ROTATION is

	-- CARRY block rather than a change here. The carry itself stays `carry` on

	-- `hold_item_walk` spawns a soda can of its own.
