--- Door locks: which world doors are managed, and who may lock or unlock them.
-- @author dop42
--
-- THE OWNER: "revoir complètement la feature des doorlock : clone le code,
-- comprends-le, fais le panel de la même logique". The model is ox_doorlock's,
-- field for field, under ox's own names: a door has a `name`, one native door or
-- two (`doors`, a double door), `coords`, a `state` (1 locked, 0 unlocked), a
-- `maxDistance`, an `autolock` delay, `auto` (an automatic door), `lockpick` and
-- its `lockpickDifficulty` sequence, the `groups` that turn it (a job or a gang
-- name to a minimum grade), the `items` that turn it (`name`, `metadata`,
-- `remove`), the `characters` that turn it, a `passcode`, `lockSound` /
-- `unlockSound`, `hideUi` and `holdOpen`. What a field means is what it means in
-- ox; where Night City cannot do the same thing the README says so ("Door locks").
--
-- A DOOR IS IDENTIFIED BY A NUMBER, as in ox: the row id of `opx77_doorlocks`,
-- given when the door is created and never reused. `/opx.doorlock.list` prints
-- every id. A native door is named by its own opaque id (`0x` and sixteen hex
-- digits) -- the staff panel's "Pick in world" reads it from the crosshair.
--
-- WHERE A DOOR LIVES. Every door is a row in `opx77_doorlocks`, and the staff
-- panel (`/opx.doorlock`) creates, edits and deletes them. `DOORS` below is ox's
-- `convert/` folder: each block is INSERTED ONCE, under its key, the first boot
-- that sees it, and from then on the row is the door -- edit it in the panel,
-- not here. Deleting a seeded door in the panel keeps a tombstone so the next
-- boot does not put it back. The doors saved by the first version of this
-- module (`opx77_doorlock`, no s) are carried over the same way on every boot,
-- once each; that table is never written to again and can be dropped by hand.
--
-- THE SERVER DECIDES. A client sends "turn door 12" and nothing else; the server
-- reads the player's own position and routing bucket from the host, the job,
-- gang and grade from the character module, the bag from the inventory module,
-- and only then moves the lock -- ox's `isAuthorised`, in ox's order:
--
--   1. staff with `command.opx.doorlock.bypass` (ox's PlayerAceAuthorised),
--      or the ACL entry `doorlock.<id>` (ox's ace `doorlock.<name>`)
--   2. a listed character                 -- opens without the code
--   3. the groups, any one at its grade   -- then the code, if the door has one
--   4. else the items, any one held       -- then the code
--   5. a door with only a code opens for whoever knows it
--
-- A door with none of these opens for staff only, as in ox.
--
-- Who may WRITE a door is the ACL:
--
--   command.opx.doorlock          open the panel, list doors
--   command.opx.doorlock.save     create and edit (the panel's Save)
--   command.opx.doorlock.remove   delete
--   command.opx.doorlock.lock     lock / unlock from anywhere
--   command.opx.doorlock.key      cut a key for a door
--   command.opx.doorlock.bypass   turn any door without a key or a code
