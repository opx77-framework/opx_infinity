--- Clothing shops: where they stand, what a change costs, and what they offer.
-- @author dop42
--
-- A SHOP IS A PLACE THAT OPENS THE FITTING ROOM AND SENDS A BILL. It owns no
-- catalogue of its own and stocks nothing: the garments a player can wear are
-- whatever `Open77.equipment.records` answers for their body, which is a CLIENT
-- read the server cannot make. That is the fact this whole file is shaped
-- around, and it is why the price is per SLOT and not per garment -- the server
-- cannot price a jacket it is not able to see, but it can price "you changed
-- what is on your legs", because the slot names are a closed set it shares with
-- the client.
--
-- SO THE BILL IS COUNTED, NOT LOOKED UP. Close the room having changed your
-- legs and your feet, and you are charged `PRICES.Legs + PRICES.Feet`. Change
-- nothing and you are charged nothing. Change the same slot four times before
-- you save and you are charged once, because what is billed is the difference
-- between what you walked in wearing and what you walked out wearing.
--
-- THE CLIENT NEVER NAMES A PRICE. It reports which slots differ; the server
-- reads its own table. A client that claimed a total, or claimed a slot was
-- free, would be a client setting its own prices.

OPX.Config.MODULES.shops = {
	enabled = true,

	-- What one changed slot costs, in EDDIES, at a shop that does not say
	-- otherwise. A slot absent from this table is FREE -- which is how underwear
	-- is free everywhere below, and how a shop is made free by giving it an
	-- empty override rather than by a flag nobody would find.
	--
	-- The nine slot names are the platform's own and are not ours to rename:
	-- Head, Face, InnerChest, OuterChest, Legs, Feet, Outfit, UnderwearTop,
	-- UnderwearBottom. A name that is not one of those is dropped at boot with a
	-- line naming it, because a typo that silently prices nothing is a shop that

	-- reach the server re-measures before it opens anything or takes any money.

	-- The shops themselves, keyed by a durable slug. THE KEY IS WRITTEN INTO

	--   LABEL     what the target row says
	--   X, Y, Z   where it stands
	--   BUCKET    routing bucket, or nil for every bucket
	--   PRICES    an override table; merged OVER the defaults above, so a shop
	--             states only what it charges differently. An empty table makes
	--             a shop free without touching CHARGE.
	--   JOBS      { job = minimumGrade }, or nil for anybody. A shop nobody but
	--             a ripperdoc may use is a shop for uniforms.

	-- Looks the server offers ready-made, which is what makes a uniform
	-- possible. A player at a shop that carries one can put it on in a single
	-- choice instead of finding seven garments.
	--
	-- THESE ARE NOT PRICED BY SLOT. A ready-made look states its own COST, once,
	-- because it is one purchase and not a rummage -- and a uniform a job hands
	-- out states `COST = 0`, which is the point of it.
	--
	-- `WEAR` is a partial record: the slots it names are set, and the slots it
	-- does NOT name are left exactly as the player already had them. `false`
	-- empties a slot. Records are TweakDB names, `Items.<something>`; a name
	-- this body cannot wear is skipped by the client with a line, because the
	-- two body families do not share every garment.
	-- ── EVERY RECORD HERE IS THE GAME'S OWN ───────────────────────────────
	--
	-- Read out of the two TweakDB files the install carries, through the
	-- platform's generated catalogue of all 1,991 wearable `Clo_*` records
	-- (`docs/research/clothing-items-catalog.md` and the JSON beside it), and
	-- each one checked for the slot it really belongs to AND for being on both
	-- body families. The four records the NCPD uniform used to name --
	-- `Items.Police_Jacket_01`, `Items.Police_Pants_01`, `Items.Police_Boots_01`
	-- and `Items.Q005_Police_Shirt` -- DO NOT EXIST, and neither did the four
	-- the corporate look named: both looks dressed NOTHING, and said nothing
	-- about it, because a record a body cannot wear is skipped with a log line
	-- rather than refused. A uniform that silently does nothing is the exact
	-- failure this file cannot test for itself, which is why `tests/run.lua`
	-- pins every name below.
	--
	-- WHAT THE GAME ACTUALLY HAS, exhaustively:
	--   NCPD  `Items.Cop_01_Set_*` -- jacket, pants, boots, glasses -- plus the
	--         questline's one-piece issue suit, `Items.SQ029_Police_Suit`.
	--   MaxTac `Items.SQ030_MaxTac_Helmet`, `_Chest`, `_Pants`. Three records
	--         and no fourth: there is no MaxTac boot, glove or undershirt that a
	--         player can wear, so those slots are left AS THE PLAYER HAD THEM --
	--         `false` would send a trooper out barefoot to no purpose.
	--   Trauma Team `Items.Trauma_Team_Outfit`, one piece, for the same job.
