--- The key, the reach of the ray, and the pace of the target eye.

-- The three timings at the bottom are the ones that were measured rather than
-- chosen. `BATCH` is the important one: resolving a pick asks every matching row
-- whether it applies, and a row whose answer lives on another resource is a host
-- call. Doing all of them in one coroutine body is what exceeded the per-resume
-- instruction budget on the resource this module was ported from, and a body that
-- exceeds it is unwound and never resumed -- silently. Five rows per slice, one
-- slice per scheduler pass, is the bound that fixed it.
--
-- `WATCH_MS` and `RESOLVE_MS` are floors, not periods: `OPX.Scheduler` sleeps
-- `IDLE_MS` (100) whenever no job is due, so anything below that runs at roughly
-- 100ms unless another job is keeping the loop busy. They are written as the pace
-- this module would like, not the pace it gets.

	--            What the player walked up to it for.
	--    10-19   ITS STATE. Locking it, turning it on.
	--    20-39   WHAT IT HOLDS. A boot, a glovebox, a stash.
	--    40-59   WORK. Gigs, jobs, anything a player took on.
	--    60-89   LEAVING. Abandoning a run, getting out.

	-- A GROUP IS SORTED WHOLE, at the lowest order any of its rows carries, so
	-- these numbers place a FOLDER as much as they place a row -- and two rows of

	-- the group `''` and are placed the same way.
