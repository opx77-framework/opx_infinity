	-- about whoever is looking at it. `character` places against it, `downed`
	-- reads fractions of it, `hud` draws it, and `admin` reports it -- four
	-- readers is exactly how a number ends up written four times and edited
	-- once. The server applies it with `Open77.players.setMaxHealth`, which is
	-- the platform's canonical maximum: the client is TOLD, never asked.

	-- tougher against a given hit by itself -- damage is the engine's -- it
	-- makes the pool deeper.

		-- punishment for a setting they did not change. A row at or above this
