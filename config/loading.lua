--- The game's own loading screen: what this resource hides behind it, and the cover.
-- @author dop42
--
-- `modules/loading` reads the platform's native loading lifecycle
-- (`Open77.screen.loadingState`) and does two things with it. It takes the
-- HUD-like views off the page while a load is up -- the gauges, the key strip,
-- the toasts, the eye, the name tags -- because they were drawn over the game's
-- own loading screen as if the player were still standing in the street. And it
-- can draw the OPX cover over that screen for the loads that happen in play: a
-- teleport, a lift between floors, a respawn. Never the join: the connection
-- screen is the platform's, and `web/loading.html` already dresses it.
--
-- A CLIENT THAT IS TOO OLD TO ANSWER LOSES BOTH AND NOTHING ELSE. The reader
-- arrived after op77.78; on a build without it the module says so once in the
-- player's own log and every view keeps exactly the visibility it had.
