--- How long a downed player waits, where they wake, and who may stand them up.

	-- scanner and the phone to the game, because a player who is up needs to aim
	-- and scan. This is a player bleeding out: they cannot aim, cannot scan, and
	-- are not taking a call. Every stock component is chrome over a screen that
	-- has one thing to say.
	--
	-- Seven of these were named and six were absent, which read as a decision and
	-- was a gap. `Open77.hud.components()` is the authority on the set; a name
	-- this build does not know is refused per component and costs nothing.
