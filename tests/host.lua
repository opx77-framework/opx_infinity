-- @author dop42
--
-- EVERY QUERY USED TO BE ATOMIC, and that made a whole class of bug unreachable.
-- `bridge.query.await` called straight through and answered on the spot, so no
-- two threads could ever be part-way through a query at the same time -- no
-- interleaving was reachable by any route, which is precisely the failure
-- `OPX.Storage` and every read-modify-write above it exist to guard against.
-- The card is exact: the continuation "resumes on the owning resource's
-- scheduler, never on the database worker". So `await` YIELDS once before it
-- answers, and the caller comes back on a later `control.Pump` round -- which
-- is what lets a test start two claims on one row and watch them overtake each
-- other.
--
-- It yields only when it is legal to: `OPX.Schema.Apply` is called straight
-- from test code, off any coroutine, and the real bridge would raise there
-- rather than silently succeed. `control.database.strict` makes it raise, so a
-- call site can be PROVED to be on a thread; the default answers instead, so
-- that proving it is a test's choice and not a precondition of every test.
--
-- THE METHOD IS A CALLABLE THAT ALSO CARRIES `.await`, which is the shape the
-- card documents ("two forms: pass a callback, or use `.await`"). It was a
-- plain table, so the documented callback form raised `attempt to call a table

		-- guide rather than a shape invented here:
		--   * `colour`, `alpha`, `opacity`, `scale`, `shortRange` and `category`
		--     are refused BY NAME as `unsupported_option:<key>`, and
		--     `kind = "radius"` as `unsupported_kind:radius`. Opacity and scale
		--     live on the UI profile the SPRITE resolves, shared by every pin
		--     using it.
		--   * `color` IS A REAL FIELD NOW -- exactly `#RRGGBB`/`#RRGGBBAA` --
		--     since the native Ink adapter grew per-widget colours; this stub
		--     refused it by name too, until the catalogue stopped listing it.
		--     A malformed value is `invalid_argument`.
		--   * `icon` is the custom SVG field: a resource-relative `.svg` path or
		--     `{ asset = path, size = 16..128 }`. Non-SVG is
		--     `blip_icon_requires_svg`, a URL/absolute/traversing path is
		--     `invalid_argument`, and an out-of-bounds size likewise. The real
		--     engine also answers `asset_not_declared:<path>`; this stub cannot
		--     see the manifest's `files` block, so every well-formed path reads
		--     as declared.
		--   * `range` outside 0..4000 is `invalid_range`.
		--   * `title` is capped at 128 bytes and `description` at 1024.
		--   * the per-resource quota is 128; the 129th create is refused.
		--   * `blips.permission = true` answers every call
		--     `permission_denied:ui.vanilla.map`, which is how an UNDECLARED
		--     client permission behaves -- silently, with the server journal
		--     saying nothing at all.
		-- `blips.refuse` is the markers stub's escape hatch, for "the API is there
		-- and said no" without naming a particular cause.
		--
		-- IDS ARE DECIMAL STRINGS AND NEVER NUMBERS. The platform's handles are

---
--- A sibling checkout by default, which is how they sit on a workstation.
--- `OPX_LIB_PATH` overrides it, and CI needs that: `actions/checkout` refuses a
--- path outside the workspace, so the runner clones the library INTO the
--- workspace and points this at it. Without the override, CI cannot see the
--- sibling at all and every client boot dies on the first `require`.

---
--- A FACTORY rather than a plain function, and the environment is the whole
--- reason. `loadfile(path)` runs a module in the REAL global table -- which is
--- not where the harness's stubbed `Open77` lives; that is in the sandbox
--- `env`. So every library wrapper resolved its natives against a table that
--- was never there, took its absent-native path for the entire suite, and the
--- SUCCESS paths of `Input`, `Rpc`, `Store` and `Players` went untested while
--- their refusals were covered. The suite loads the real library precisely so
--- the two repositories cannot drift; loading it blind to the stub gave up
--- most of that.
---
--- The cache moves inside for the same reason. It was module-level and shared
--- across every environment the suite builds, where the platform caches per
--- caller generation -- two consumers get two copies. Per environment is both
--- the faithful shape and what lets the stub differ between tests.
