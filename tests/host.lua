-- @author dop42
--
-- EVERY QUERY USED TO BE ATOMIC, and that made a whole class of bug unreachable.
-- `bridge.query.await` called straight through and answered on the spot, so no
-- two threads could ever be part-way through a query at the same time -- no
-- interleaving was reachable by any route, which is precisely the failure
-- `OPX.Storage` and every read-modify-write above it exist to guard against.
-- The card is exact: the continuation "resumes on the owning resource's
-- scheduler, never on the database worker". So `await` YIELDS once before it
-- answers, and the caller comes back on a later `control.Pump` round -- which
-- is what lets a test start two claims on one row and watch them overtake each
-- other.
--
-- It yields only when it is legal to: `OPX.Schema.Apply` is called straight
-- from test code, off any coroutine, and the real bridge would raise there
-- rather than silently succeed. `control.database.strict` makes it raise, so a
-- call site can be PROVED to be on a thread; the default answers instead, so
-- that proving it is a test's choice and not a precondition of every test.
--
-- THE METHOD IS A CALLABLE THAT ALSO CARRIES `.await`, which is the shape the
-- card documents ("two forms: pass a callback, or use `.await`"). It was a
-- plain table, so the documented callback form raised `attempt to call a table

--- Names the sandbox removes on BOTH runtimes. Loading code that reaches for one
--- is a failure the test should report here rather than on the test server.
Host.Sandbox = { 'io', 'os', 'debug', 'package', 'dofile', 'loadfile' }

--- Names the CLIENT VM has and the dedicated server does not.
---
--- `require` is the whole list, and it is separated from `Host.Sandbox` rather
--- than dropped from it because the distinction is real and load-bearing: a
--- `client_script` may import a library, and a `shared_script` that did the same
--- would break the moment the server loaded it. Merging the two lists would
--- either forbid a legal import or permit an illegal one.
Host.ClientOnly = { 'require' }

--- Where a published dependency library lives.
---
--- A sibling checkout by default, which is how they sit on a workstation.
--- `OPX_LIB_PATH` overrides it, and CI needs that: `actions/checkout` refuses a
--- path outside the workspace, so the runner clones the library INTO the
--- workspace and points this at it. Without the override, CI cannot see the
--- sibling at all and every client boot dies on the first `require`.
---
--- The suite loads the REAL library rather than a stub on purpose -- a stub
--- would pass while the two repositories drifted apart -- so a missing checkout
--- has to be loud rather than skipped.
Host.Providers = { opx_lib = os.getenv('OPX_LIB_PATH') or '../opx_lib' }

--- Builds the client VM's `require` for ONE environment.
---
--- A FACTORY rather than a plain function, and the environment is the whole
--- reason. `loadfile(path)` runs a module in the REAL global table -- which is
--- not where the harness's stubbed `Open77` lives; that is in the sandbox
--- `env`. So every library wrapper resolved its natives against a table that
--- was never there, took its absent-native path for the entire suite, and the
--- SUCCESS paths of `Input`, `Rpc`, `Store` and `Players` went untested while
--- their refusals were covered. The suite loads the real library precisely so
--- the two repositories cannot drift; loading it blind to the stub gave up
--- most of that.
---
--- The cache moves inside for the same reason. It was module-level and shared
--- across every environment the suite builds, where the platform caches per
--- caller generation -- two consumers get two copies. Per environment is both
--- the faithful shape and what lets the stub differ between tests.
