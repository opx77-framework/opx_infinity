// OPX Infinity -- the base game's own Sandevistan, for the ripperdoc's
// Sandevistans (opx_infinity, modules/ripperdoc/client/sandevistan.lua), on the
// player's own machine. opx_sandy_view 1.4.8.
//
// WHAT THE BASE GAME DOES. `SandevistanEvents.OnEnter` (2.31):
//
//   1. `SetCameraTimeDilationCurve(n"Sandevistan")` -- the camera samples the
//      clock through the Sandevistan's own curve;
//   2. `SetTimeDilationGlobal(n"sandevistan", <the implant's scale>, 999)`,
//      which for the reason `sandevistan` first calls
//      `SetIgnoreTimeDilationOnLocalPlayerZero(true)`: the WORLD slows -- NPCs,
//      traffic, physics, particles, sound -- and V does not;
//   3. the keyboard's `SlowMotion` lighting;
//   4. on exit, `UnsetTimeDilation(n"sandevistan", n"SandevistanEaseOut")`.
//
// WHO DOES WHAT HERE. A multiplayer session refuses every scripted dilation
// but one: a time-scale CLAIM (`Open77.world.setTimeScale`), which the platform
// writes on the global layer under the reason `open77:<resource>` and which
// stands the session's dilation guard down while it is live. The owner's own
// Sandevistan is claimed by THIS resource's client script (`opx_sandy_view`),
// so its reason -- `open77:opx_sandy_view` -- is the owner's alone: players
// slowed AROUND the owner run opx_infinity's claim and are not exempted.
//
// THE CLAIM'S VALUE SAYS WHAT IT IS. Below 0.99 it is a boost. From 0.99 to
// just under 1 it is a MESSAGE from this resource's client script -- a Lua
// resource has no other way to reach this script -- held for 600 ms at
// `0.999 - code / 10000` (the world 0.1 % slower for half a second): code 1
// asks for the Militech Apogee Sandevistan in the Operating System slot, 0 for
// none. A code is taken only when two samples in a row agree, so an ease can
// never be read as one.
//
// WHAT RUNS WHERE (1.4.0). Everything that has to happen on time runs on the
// game's delay system, in real time, one watch per body, each holding its own
// state (the engine attaches bodies on several worker threads at once, so
// nothing is shared between them -- 1.3.0 shared one list and crashed):
//
//   * the OWNER's watch (V): exempt from the world's dilation while the boost
//     holds (asserted every 100 ms), the keyboard lit, both handed back the
//     moment it ends; and the real item;
//   * the THIRD-PERSON MODEL's watch: Open77's self view draws V in third
//     person as a body of its own (`Character.Open77ProxyMaleMirror` /
//     `...FemaleMirror`, an NPCPuppet on V's TPP template, standing where V
//     stands, parked hidden on V in first person). For the boost it gets V's
//     exemption (an individual dilation of 1.0 that ignores the global one)
//     and, while the camera really stands behind it, Adam Smasher's own
//     Sandevistan played on it by the names its template authors:
//     `eye_glow_gold`. (Until 1.4.3 also his NPC Sandevistan's screen-space
//     echoes, `fx_sandevistan_left` / `_right` and `fx_sandevistan_versus_loop`:
//     they smear copies of the SCREEN around the body, which next to the real
//     ghost read as broken clones in the wrong place; 1.4.4 plays none of them
//     and only stops them, in case an older build started them.)
//
// The stamina machine's per-frame update still asserts V's exemption every
// frame it runs and asks for the camera curve -- the one thing only a player
// state machine can do -- but nothing depends on it running: in a session it
// does not run every frame (1.3.1's log showed it see a boost start and never
// see it end).
//
// THE REAL ITEM. Open77 has no API that installs a base-game operating system
// on a player (its equipment API answers `invalid_record` for the Apogee), so
// the owner's watch does it with the base game's own equipment system, the way
// Open77's own script bridge fits a weapon: the item is looked up in the
// inventory BY ITS RECORD (1.4.1 asked for `ItemID.FromTDBID(record)`, an id the
// inventory never holds -- a given item gets a seed of its own -- so the base
// game's `EquipRequest` gave a new Apogee on every try and fitted none, and the
// log said "not in the inventory"), given once if there is none, fitted with
// `OnGameplayEquipRequest` on that very id, and read back from the slot. It is
// checked once a second, fitted again if something took it off (five tries per
// request, then it says why not), and taken off and out of the inventory --
// every copy of that record -- when the ripperdoc says none. What was asked for
// survives a new body (quest fact `opx_sandy_wear`); what this file fitted is
// remembered too (`opx_sandy_fitted`). While it is fitted, the base game's own
// Sandevistan activation is off (`SandevistanDecisions.EnterCondition`): the
// key and the slowdown stay the ripperdoc's.
//
// SMASHER'S GHOST TRAIL -- ON THE PLAYER'S OWN MODEL (1.4.2). The afterimages
// Adam Smasher leaves when he dashes under his Sandevistan are his meshes drawn
// with the base game's `base\fx\_shaders\sandevistan_multilayer.mt`, switched
// on by `ch_smasher_sandevistan_high.effect`'s `customParameter0` tracks: the
// shader draws the copies BEHIND a body that moves, so the trail shows while
// the body runs, dashes or jumps, and a body that stands still covers its own
// ghost. This resource's archive (V's own body files, `t0_000_base__full.app`
// and its censored cut, with the parts added -- up to 1.4.7 an ArchiveXL patch
// of them) gives every player body the SAME shader on the player's OWN silhouette: parts of V's own third-person
// body (torso, legs, feet), arms and hands and base head (rigid on `Head`),
// each wearing the appearance `opx_sandy_ghost` (`opx_sandy_ghost.mi`: the
// shader with Smasher's armour layers) -- switched OFF -- and the effect
// spawner `opx_sandy_ghost_fx`, with a trigger that drives nothing
// (`opx_sandy_ghost_on`). Up to 1.4.5 one set of four parts
// (`opx_sandy_ghost_body`, `_arm_l`, `_arm_r`, `_head`); from 1.4.6 four
// layers of them (`opx_sandy_ghost1_*` .. `opx_sandy_ghost4_*`).
//
// 1.4.2, after 1.4.1 switched its parts on and drew nothing: the parts are
// V's own garment components (V's meshes are garment meshes), the material is
// the unmasked one every working copy of it outside Smasher's own files uses,
// and the effects are the archive's own: Smasher's peak held for 30 s without
// a loop (1.4.2 shipped a fade-in and a hold of it; 1.4.5 plays one held from
// its first frame, below). The effect starts AFTER the parts come on, a part
// that is already on is never switched again (1.4.1 switched every half
// second, which may rebuild what the effect drives). Every lighting says what
// the body really carries: how many parts, of what class
// (1.4.2's are `entGarmentSkinnedMeshComponent`; anything else is an old
// archive), how many the engine says are on, and whether the spawner is there.
//
//   * the owner's third-person model: its watch, while the camera stands
//     behind it (never in first person, where the parts would fill the view);
//   * every other client's copy of the boosted player -- every client the
//     boosted body is streamed to, i.e. everybody near it: opx_infinity's look
//     plays the trigger by name on that body for the whole boost; the body's
//     own callback below answers it with a watch of its own that switches the
//     parts on as soon as the body has them (a body still being dressed has
//     none yet), keeps its afterimages placed, and ends with the trigger.
//
// 1.4.3 (a test build) un-hid every part it switched on, every step --
// Open77's self view parks the third-person model with `TemporaryHide(true)`
// on every skinned mesh and lifts only what it hid, by name, so parts switched
// on afterwards could stay hidden -- and the ghost DREW: the player's
// screenshots showed its body (moved 1 m aside by a probe) beside V's, with
// the NPC Sandevistan's screen-space echoes smeared over the whole picture.
//
// 1.4.4 un-hid a part only for its first 0.6 s, dropped the probes and the NPC
// Sandevistan's screen-space echoes on the owner's model, and started the
// trail at 0.1 of Smasher's strength (the smallest of five): the player saw no
// ghost at all. The guess it tested -- that a body exempt from the world's
// slowdown reads too fast -- does not hold: the base game's own Sandevistan
// exempts V the same way (`SetIgnoreTimeDilationOnLocalPlayerZero(true)`),
// and ESDE plays Smasher's full (1.5, 1) on V's body in single player with the
// same shader, the same Smasher armour layers and the same kind of parts
// (garment components, switched off, no shadows).
//
// 1.4.5 was that setup, with each link that could have failed made robust --
// Smasher's full (1.5, 1), the effect held from its first frame to its last
// and started three times, the parts un-hidden every step -- and its log says
// every step ran (parts 4 of 4 on, the trail started at 0.3 s, 1 s and 2.6 s),
// and the player saw no trail: whatever breaks it, the shader's own copies do
// not show on this body.
//
// 1.4.6 therefore draws the afterimages itself: FOUR LAYERS of the ghost's
// parts (the archive's 16), each placed every frame where the body was 0.08,
// 0.16, 0.24 and 0.32 s before -- the path it really ran -- in this frame's
// pose, as Smasher's own copies are. What draws them is the part itself (the
// material's first pass), moved by its own placement and un-hidden every
// frame: 1.4.3's screenshots showed exactly that on screen (its body part,
// moved 1 m aside by `SetLocalPosition`, beside V). Smasher's effect is no
// longer played.
//
// 1.4.7: 1.4.6's afterimages were never placed -- its next-frame ticker ran
// twice in half a second and stopped ("2 frames in 0.58 s"), and not one
// layer was shown while the player sprinted 9 m/s. The ticker is now a 5 ms
// timed callback, the kind every watch in this file runs on, and the watch
// that lit the body places them too, every tenth of a second. The player
// confirmed the trail on their own third-person model.
//
// 1.4.8: a second player saw no trail -- not on the boosted player, not on
// their own model -- and their log said why: "0 of 16 parts (none), its
// effect spawner MISSING". Their game runs no ArchiveXL (RED4ext loaded one
// plugin, Open77), so the patch that gave player bodies the parts never ran
// there. The archive now carries V's two body files themselves, the base
// game's own with the parts added, which the game loads by their depot path
// with no plugin at all; the `.xl` is gone. Also:
//   * every other player's copy of the boosted body is exempt from this
//     machine's dilation for the boost (the same individual dilation the
//     owner's model gets), so a player slowed by the boost sees the owner at
//     full speed in a slowed world, as the owner sees themselves;
//   * the third-person model says, when it attaches, how many ghost parts
//     this game gives player bodies -- 16 of 16, or 0 and why;
//   * the afterimage lines read the farthest one's part back from the engine
//     (`GetLocalToWorld`), so "shown" is measured where the engine drew it.

// WHAT IT SAYS. Each change is one line in the Open77 client log, through the
// platform's REDscript trace (`Open77 pristine player bootstrap trace: ...`,
// written only when the text changes): `opx_sandy_view owner: ...`,
// `opx_sandy_view model: ...`, `opx_sandy_view real item: ...`,
// `opx_sandy_view ghost: ...`, `opx_sandy_view afterimages: ...` (how often
// they are placed, and how many show) and `opx_sandy_view curve: ...`.
